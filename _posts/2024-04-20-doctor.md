# Machine Info

Doctor was an Low rated Linux machine on Vulnyx, involved exploiting **Path Traversal** Vulnerability to read encrypted **id_rsa** key which then be cracked using **john** to get initial access on the box. For privilege Escalation, we will abuse write permission on `/etc/passwd` file to gain access to root.

# User 
## Scanning through Nmap

First of all we will go with nmap to scan the whole network and check for services running on the network. To scan the whole network and find all the open ports i use **-p-** used to scan the whole **65535** ports with **--min-rate 10000** to scan network faster from **nmap** and i found a list of open ports on the network and get only the open ports using different terminal tools like **cut**, **tr** etc. 

```shell
$ nmap -p- --min-rate 10000 192.168.190.135 -oN ini.txt && cat ini.txt | cut  -d ' ' -f1 | tr -d '/tcp' | tr '\n' ','
22,80
```

Now Let's run the depth scan on these specific ports using 

```bash
$ nmap -p22,80 -sC -sV -A -T4 192.168.190.135 -oN scan.txt
```

- **-sC** is to run all the default scripts
- **-sV** for service and version detection
- **-A** to check all default things
- **-T4** for aggressive scan
- **-oN** to write the result into a specified file

```bash
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 7.9p1 Debian 10+deb10u2 (protocol 2.0)
| ssh-hostkey:
|   2048 44:95:50:0b:e4:73:a1:85:11:ca:10:ec:1c:cb:d4:26 (RSA)

```

## Information Gathering

Through Nmap, we found two open ports, **22 SSH** version `7.9p1`, on port **80 HTTP** `Apache 2.4.38` is running on web server. **SSH** version also reveals that there is a Debian based OS running on the machine.  

## Port 80 HTTP

On web server, there is some kind of Hospital website is running. They are providing healthcare services.

On doctors tab on navbar, developer is accessing `Doctor.html` file directly in include function. which is vulnerable to **Path Traversal or Directory Traversal** vulnerability. The attacker can change the path of file to access any other sensitive file without any permission. The below code is describing the working behind the application.

```php
$file = $_GET['file'];
include($file);
```

### Exploiting Path Traversal 

Let's try to read the `/etc/passwd` file which is a file in Linux like systems, that hold the username and their role on the system. Our exploit worked, we can read our user.txt flag directly from here or later after getting shell on the box.

<img alt="Pasted image 20240420110706" src="https://github.com/iammR0OT/Vulnyx/assets/74102381/5a557115-c813-4caa-9a1e-eea0daa83026">

### Reading id_rsa

We can also try to read `id_rsa` file from the system. In SSH, **id_rsa** is a **private key** used to sign and authenticate connection on remote server. The path to `id_rsa` is `/home/username/.ssh/id_rsa`. From `/etc/passwd` file, we found our current user is admin. Let's get it's private key and save it in a file.

### Cracking id_rsa key

The private key is encrypted with **DES-EDE3-CBC**, which is described on the 2nd line of key. Let's try to crack it. We will use tool called **ssh2john** to convert this rsa key to the understandable hash for **john**, password cracking tool.

<img alt="Pasted image 20240420125839" src="https://github.com/iammR0OT/Vulnyx/assets/74102381/67770481-9bbf-43ae-83b6-79945f7f17de">

After cracking the hash using john with format **ssh**, we found the key as **unicorn**. 

```bash
$ john  --format=ssh hash.txt -w /usr/share/seclists/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou.txt
```

## Initial Access

Now, we have both the key and the encrypted RSA key. We will first decrypt it and then parse to server to gain shell on the box.
We will use tool called **openssl** to decrypt the key and save it to decrypted id_rsa key file and give it **read** and **write** permissions using **chmod**.
OpenSSL is **an open-source command line tool that is commonly used to generate private keys, create CSRs, install your SSL/TLS certificate, and identify certificate information**.

```bash
$ openssl rsa -in id_rsa.enc -out id_rsa
$ chmod 600 id_rsa
```

Now get a shell on the box using the decypted private key.

```bash
$ ssh -i id_rsa admin@192.168.190.135
```

# Privilege Escalation

For enumeration on box, we will be using **linpease.sh** from Linux Privilege Escalation Awesome Scripts..
LinPEAS is **an open-source script designed to automate the process of searching for potential privilege escalation vulnerabilities on Linux/Unix/macOS systems**.

Linpeas reveals that we have write permissions on `/etc/passwd` file
The `/etc/passwd` file stores user account information for each user on the system. Each line in the file represents a single user account. Each line in the `/etc/passwd` file consists of several fields separated by colons (:).
The second filed in `/etc/passwd` file is for hashed password for each user, which is stored in `/etc/shadow` file. If someone has write permission on `/etc/passwd` file, he can insert his own password for any of the user on the system and can get access to his account.

Let's make this attack practical. First create a password with openssl and the paste it in the `/etc/passwd` file against the entry of root user.

```bash
$ openssl passwd iamroot
$1$lmiGWtxa$zCNKkATEazyjE0nMDOaQH/
```

Now use **su** to get shell as a root user on the box and you can see we got root user on the box.

# Mitigation

For Path traversal vulnerability, use `basename()` and `realpath()` functions. 
The `basename()` function returns only the filename part of a given path/filename: `basename("../../../etc/passwd")` = _passwd_. The `realpath()` function returns the canonicalized absolute pathname but only if the file exists and if the running script has executable permissions on all directories in the hierarchy: `realpath("../../../etc/passwd")` = `/etc/passwd`.

```php
$file = basename(realpath($_GET['file']));
include($file);
```

For root remove write permissions on `/etc/passwd` file for everyone except root user itself.
